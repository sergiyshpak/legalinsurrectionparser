He's on some kind of scooter. </p><p><br></p><p>Joke is supposed to be: Why did police shoot Jacob Blake 7 times? Because they ran out of bullets. </p>
2021-11-04T14:14:13Z<br><p>So that juror is dismissed for cause. </p>

2021-11-04T14:23:29Z<br><p>Richards:  You wrote 57 police report, summarizes much of your involvement in this case. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Page 55, received thumb drive from FBI?</p><p><br></p><p>My colleague.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Viewed information from that thumb drive.</p><p><br></p><p>Sorry, I was thinking about aircraft footage, but yes I also received thumb drive. </p>

2021-11-04T14:26:53ZRe-direct of Det. Howard by Prosecutor Binger<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T14:27:33Z<br><p>Binger:  You were aksed about search warrant for Grosskreutz phone?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Did you consider him to be the victim of a crime?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Marcy's law? </p><p><br></p><p>New law that grants crime victims certain rights. </p>
2021-11-04T14:28:00Z<br><p>Binger:  Took effect on May 4, 2020. </p><p><br></p><p>No objection.  Judge explains judicial notice to the jury. </p>
2021-11-04T14:31:12Z<br><p>Binger:  </p><p><br></p><p>At that time, unclear to what extent Marcy's Law would affect ability to apply search warrants, was not thinking about Marcy's at time, but started thinking about it afterwards.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Normal practice with PD when you decide what interviews will be recorded, and which you may not record?</p><p><br></p><p>Always record custodial subjects. Four interview rooms, three always record no matter what, fourth we put complaining witnesses without necessarily recorded. The interviews we conducted, we didn't intend to record all of them, but some were in the rooms that always recording. Unintentional recordings.  Ones in room not always recording, not a record of those. </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T14:31:31Z<br><p>Binger:  Fair to say, when you are dealing with someone YOU consider to be the victim of a crime you don't normally record those?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-04T14:32:19Z<br><p>Binger:  Asked about jump kick man, never identified him.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  IN 14 months, experienced individuals reluctant to come forward?</p><p><br></p><p>A lot. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Why do you think that is?</p><p><br></p><p>Objection, speculation, sustained. </p>
2021-11-04T14:32:46Z<br><p>Binger:  Allegation Rosenbaum had a chain, you've seen photos that show that?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  When in evening did he have that chain?</p><p><br></p><p>I know location? The area of St. James. </p>
2021-11-04T14:34:09Z<br><p>Binger:  Defense alludes to Rosenbaum being involved in altercations, does Rosenbaum have a weapon in his hand at those times?  No gun, no knife, no chain? </p><p><br></p><p>Not at ultimate gas. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Only bag?</p><p><br></p><p>South of 60th, yes. </p>
2021-11-04T14:35:28Z<br><p>Binger:  As Rosenbaum walking to Car Source, any indication he's ever armed with anything?  No gun, knife ...</p><p><br></p><p>Objection, asked and answered.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Different part of sequence.</p><p><br></p><p>Overruled.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  At time he is shot and killed, any evidence that Rosenbaum was armed? </p><p><br></p><p>No. Plastic bag he threw, then nothing in his hands. </p>
2021-11-04T14:41:40Z<br><p>Binger:  Exhibit #19. Drew Hernandez shooting video.  </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Now showing FBI aerial image. </p><p><br></p><p>Point at which Rosenbaum is hiding among four cars in corner of lot, and Kyle about to go past that position. </p>
2021-11-04T14:44:26Z<br><p>Binger: Can you tell where Rosenbaum went initially? </p><p><br></p><p>He's hiding among those cars, not sure what the point is here. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Shot fired by Joshua Ziminsky, did he fire that shot in the direction of any person.</p><p><br></p><p>Objection.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge: How would know? Set foundation.</p><p><br></p><p>Straight up in the air. </p><p><br></p><p>[Of course, Kyle wouldn't know that!]</p>
2021-11-04T14:45:02Z<br><p>Binger: Testified gap between that shot and when Rittenhouse shot was 2.5 seconds?</p><p><br></p><p>Stopwatch, used 5 or 6 of the videos. </p><p><br></p><p>That's it for re-direct of Det. Howard. </p>
2021-11-04T14:49:13ZRe-cross of Det. Howard by Attorney Richards<br><p>Richards:  Video 19, just shown, you pointed to, where Hernandez on grass. When you talk about white sedan, that's the one centered on this frame?</p><p><br></p><p>yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Your belief that looking at aerial footage that he would have went up to front passenger tire, where Rosenbaum went.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Here, or between these two vehicles, I'm point at white sedan and silver Caddilac. </p><p><br></p><p>White sedan, I estimate. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: And not between the two vehicles?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Can we have the aerial video please?  Person of interest one is Rosenbaum?  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Correct me if I'm wrong, there's a vehicle I'm point out which is the one nearest the house on that block, so he's not on the passenger side, he's between the two cars.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, that's what it appears, FBI has a better depcition.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: So when you testify he's on the passenger side, that's not correct.</p><p><br></p><p>That's not correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Kyle doesn't go into cars after Rosenbaum?</p><p><br></p><p>He does not.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Walks down to location to the corner of duramax vehicle, where the individual comes up vbehind him, Rosenbaum?</p><p><br></p><p>Rosenbaum comes around those vehicles towards Rittenhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>RIchards: You're not suggesting that there was more than one chase?</p><p><br></p><p>At any point in evening?</p><p><br></p><p>Richardfs: CAr Source 3 at that night at this time?</p><p><br></p><p>I observed one chase on this property.</p>
2021-11-04T14:50:09Z<br><p>Richards: You testified on re-direct about Marcy's Law, you couldn't go on the phone even with a search warrant?</p><p><br></p><p>It was a consideration.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  You went into Huber phone without a warrant?</p><p><br></p><p>He was deceased.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: He's still a victim.</p><p><br></p><p>Can't consent.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  His estate.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T14:51:31Z<br><p>Richards: You drafted and swore search warrant on Grosskreutz phone and never served?</p><p><br></p><p>No, because wasn't comfortable with Marcy's Law.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: If you don't have a search warrant can get into phone other ways?</p><p><br></p><p>Grosskreutz? Consent or search warrant.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: And consent was asked for? Turned down?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>And that's it for re-cross of Det. Howard. </p>
2021-11-04T14:51:38ZState Calls Richie McGinnis<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T14:54:12Z<br><p>I guess the role of McGinnis will be played by Matthew McConaughey in the Rittenhouse movie. </p><p><br></p><p class="ql-align-right"><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T14:54:25Z<br><p>McGinnis head of video for Daily Caller, online news source. </p>
2021-11-04T14:54:36Z<br><p>McGinnis on direct by ADA Binger. </p>
2021-11-04T14:55:08Z<br><p>Binger: A journalist?</p><p><br></p><p>Would say I work alongside journalists. They post articles, I'm the one that works the video. </p>
2021-11-04T14:55:47Z<br><p>Binger: Founders of Daily Caller</p><p><br></p><p>Neil Patel and Tucker Carlson</p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T14:59:18Z<br><p>Binger asking McGinnis about violent protests he's been at. </p><p><br></p><p>Presumably Binger will make argument, again, so tiresome, that nobody was killed at THOSE events, so therefore Kyle could not have been justified at killing at KENOSHA event.</p><p><br></p><p>Guess we'll see. </p>
2021-11-04T14:59:52Z<br><p>Binger: When crowd turned on you at NY, did you feel safety at risk?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Did you suffer actual injury?</p><p><br></p><p>No, not in that instance, but have other instances. </p>
2021-11-04T15:00:45Z<br><p>Binger: Shooting of Jacob Blake, August 23, 2020.  After that you became interested in coming to Kenosha?</p><p><br></p><p>Two of our reporters asked me to make the trip. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Eventually decision made to come here.  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, arrived Monday, August 24, the afternoon. Still daylight. </p>
2021-11-04T15:02:27Z<br><p>Binger: Things that happened around town, you witnessed some of that.</p><p><br></p><p>Many cars being burned, big car lot burned and also the armed individuals were on night of shooting, we were there the night before and there were people, the owner had asked people to put out fires, she recoreded people using power washer and buckets to put out fires of the cars.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: We have map on wall behind you, on Monday night the Car Source at northeast corner of 59th and Sherida had a large number of cars destroyed by fire.  Witness that?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You spoke to owner?</p><p><br></p><p>No, I spoke to individuals there, not the owner, they said owner had asked them for help. </p>
2021-11-04T15:03:09Z<br><p>Binger: Second location, this car source, armed invididuals there Tuesday night, </p><p><br></p><p>that's the same ubisness we saw people with power washers. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Monday night, armed people there? </p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Fires there?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T15:04:00Z<br><p>Binger: The fires were out of control at other lot at that point.  You witnessed fires at those two locations, other firest Monday night?</p><p><br></p><p>There were fires everywhere. Multiple businesses also burned.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Recorded that, published stories on it. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T15:05:21Z<br><p>Binger: Tuesday Aug. 25, came back to that area?</p><p><br></p><p>We went to courthouse to document demonstrations there, and subsequently police pushed everyone, protestors, demonstratiors, rioters away from the courthouse, when everybody ended up in that area.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Tuesday night, first covering things? </p><p><br></p><p>We'd been out all day. Owners of businesses that had been damaged the night before, and many people from Kenosha community came out to clean up, more interviews with them, aerial footage of damage, went and ate, and went back out before sunset when demonstrators arrived at courthouse. </p>
2021-11-04T15:06:00Z<br><p>Binger: Any of your video of cleaning up, any of that include Rittenhouse?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: When got out at night?</p><p><br></p><p>7pm.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: How long before police pushed? </p><p><br></p><p>That was after dark, 8:30 or 9pm.</p>
2021-11-04T15:09:40Z<br><p>Binger: What did you do then?</p><p><br></p><p>Goal to show what police are dealing with, also the protestors, who both, so I was in the middle. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Why did you feel situation was escalating?</p><p><br></p><p>Any time there are guns, more danger, I've been at many protests, where many people have guns, confined space, everyone is passionate, the presence of weapons meant I should be on the ground and me and my colleagues should stay close.[</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Presence of guns made you concerned for safety?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-04T15:10:26Z<br><p>Binger: You referrred to guns, familiar with guns yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>I'd say familiar.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: One in this case is a S&amp;W MP-15, an AR type rifle. Familiar with that type?</p><p><br></p><p>I've shot it.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Saw people at Car Source with that type rifle?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, several. </p>
2021-11-04T15:12:49Z<br><p>Binger: How many?</p><p><br></p><p>Three on ground, unsure how many on the roof, but perhaps 5 or 6 total, trying to present as unassuming as possible, asked if anyone willing to be interviewed.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You gave interviews to other media about your perceptions? You described these men as menacing?</p><p><br></p><p>I would say not a bad word, the presence of weapons in my mind is elevates the level of risk.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You did interview, Kyle Houten, indicated the group armed at 59th St. Car Source appeared menacing.  </p><p><br></p><p>I don't know exact definition of word menacing, using it in a live interview, the level of risk was elevated.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T15:12:51Z<br><p>[Binger is using "menacing" to mean "threatening," but McGinnis means "increased risk," two very different things--defense presumably will clarify on cross.]</p>
2021-11-04T15:16:28Z<br><p>Binger now playing McGinis video interview where he says "menacing situation"--actually prefaces comemnts by saying Kyle most willing to be interviewed, volunteered himself. </p><p><br></p><p>So McGinnis saying the SITUATION menacing, not the MEN menacing.  And particularly not Kyle, who was helpful and cooperative. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: How many did you interview there?</p><p><br></p><p>One.  Balch wandered in,  two if you count him, but Rittenhouse was only one interviewed prior to that. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T15:16:37Z<br><p>Binger now playing McGinis video interview where he says "menacing situation"--actually prefaces comemnts by saying Kyle most willing to be interviewed, volunteered himself. </p><p><br></p><p>So McGinnis saying the SITUATION menacing, not the MEN menacing.

2021-11-04T15:17:49Z<br><p>Binger: Did you ask Rittenhouse how old he was?</p><p><br></p><p>I did, but I was doing two things at once, but just recall answer satisfactory enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: If defendant had been honest with you and told you he was 17, would you have recorded?</p><p><br></p><p>I'd need permission of parents. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You had no indication that he was 17?</p><p><br></p><p>I told police I thought he was in mid-20s, but he had a baby face.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T15:18:34ZIs state's best evidence that Kyle said he was an adult?<br><p>So is Kyle to be charged for purportedly lying to McGinnis about his age, when even McGinnis can't recall interaction with clarity? </p><p><br></p><p>Is this realy the best evidence the state has?</p>
2021-11-04T15:19:29Z<br><p>Now showing McGinnis video of Kyle, I'm here to protect people, other people here to protect me, protect everybody, we're running medical.  I'm from the area.  Here to provide medical attention to people who need it, if anybody is injured. </p><p><br></p><p>I mean, this all makes Kyle look great. </p>
2021-11-04T15:20:22Z<br><p>Kyle talking about de-escalating situation where fire tried to be set at church, put a fire out elsewhere. </p><p><br></p><p>What a monster. </p><p><br></p><p>Kyle notes that EMS is not coming in, so we citizens need to help each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Monster.</p>
2021-11-04T15:22:43Z<br><p>Binger:  Walking south on Sheridan behind Kyle and Balch.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. [Obviously Kyle was terrifying.] Looked like he was trying to do what he was talking about, provide medical, I wanted to record it.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Exhibit 17.   Defendant tells you that he's an EMT?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Any other credentials?</p><p><br></p><p>Life guard?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T15:23:34Z<br><p>Binger:  In your experience, seen others proclaim to be medics who are armed with AR-15s.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw a lot of medics armed, but not with AR-15s.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  What armed with?</p><p><br></p><p>Handgun.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Other than that one, any other medics in any other events armed with gun?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  With AR-15?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p>
2021-11-04T15:24:09Z<br><p>Again, all Binger seems to have is innuendo--nothing about Kyle acting as a medic armed with AR has anything do to with his legal justification of self-defense. </p>
2021-11-04T15:24:50Z<br><p>Kyle walking down street: Anybody need medical? Anybody need medical? </p><p><br></p><p>What a monster.</p>
2021-11-04T15:25:31Z<br><p>Kyle is told someone got shot, goes over to help, turns out it was a rubber bullet, no serious injury. </p>
2021-11-04T15:26:06Z<br><p>Kyle: Anybody need medical? Anybody need medical? Medical? </p><p><br></p><p>Kyle encounters hostile young black men, just turns around and walks away.</p><p><br></p><p>Anybody need medical? Medical? </p>
2021-11-04T15:27:03ZJudge wants a break, court in recess. 15 minutes, to 10:45 CT<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T15:49:27ZAnd we're back, continuing direct of Richard McGinnis by ADA Binger<br>
2021-11-04T15:51:05Z<br><p>Binger:  Video of you following Kyle.</p><p><br></p><p>[This is one where Kyle offering medical endlessly.]</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Bright yellow pants man [hostile young black men], then defendant walks away, but you stayed. </p><p><br></p><p>Kyle had his mission he told me, provide medical, these other people had different understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: These other people claimed Kyle pointed gun a them.</p><p><br></p><p>Waving gun around, something like that. </p>
2021-11-04T15:52:49Z<br><p>Binger: Why did you stop recording that interaction?</p><p><br></p><p>Four individuals, one had large rocks in hand, public street, from perspective of ethical and journalist providing content, want permission of people to conduct interview, one of them, with bricks in hands stepped out on me like he was going to smash my head, so I put my camera down and asked why they were mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Did you ask to record them?</p><p><br></p><p>Based on this guy's actions clear they didn't want to be recorded, so I decided to not record and just ask why they were made.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Gathering information without a record doesn't do much good, does it?</p><p><br></p><p>It does do good, can ascertain other individuals to talk to, gaining their trust before you start recording, etc. </p>
2021-11-04T15:54:01Z<br><p>Binger:  Did you ask any of them for permission to record them? Assuming the answer is no?</p><p><br></p><p>I mentioned that I stopped my phone, said I'm not recording this, I just want to know what your deal is, why you are mad. Clear to me answer was no, guy had bricks in his hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: So you never aksed permission, they never gave permission.</p><p><br></p><p>No, they did not.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You took their reaction, ths physical movement as sign you shouldn't record.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T15:54:51Z<br><p>Binger:  You said they had objects in their hand.</p><p><br></p><p>I guess not bricks, they were gray, pieces of gray stones that you would use to build a building.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  How many did you speak to?</p><p><br></p><p>There were four. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  One had a couple of rocks or stones?</p><p><br></p><p>One had one in each hand, and another had stone in one hand, and a leather strap that seemed to be.</p>
2021-11-04T15:55:56Z<br><p>Binger:  Other than what you just described, see any other weapons?</p><p><br></p><p>At time did not, but in hindsight believe one was armed with handguns.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Person in yellow pants, no weapons?</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I could see.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  YOu perceived two of them to have rocks in hands, that was extent of weapons that you saw at that time.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Never really clear in these situations who is armed and who is not. I was unsure of my safety.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Were you armed?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p>
2021-11-04T15:56:29Z<br><p>Binger:  All four of them are black?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  What made you concerned about your safety?</p><p><br></p><p>One stepped out presenting rock as if ready to smash my head, he stepped toward me, I took one step back. </p><p><br></p><p>[Clearly aggressive conduct.]</p>
2021-11-04T15:57:28Z<br><p>Binger:  Any idea why he stepped forward in such an aggressive manner?</p><p><br></p><p>My phone, he perceived me to be recording him, he didn't want that.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Did his demeanor change?</p><p><br></p><p>I put phone down, his demeanor did NOT change, still seemed posture that he wanted to hit me. </p><p><br></p><p>I carry cigarettes and White Claws to diffuse these situations, so shared those. </p>
2021-11-04T15:58:50Z<br><p>Binger:  In these crowds, you have experienced anger, threatening behavior before.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Diffuse by offering cigarettes and White Claw?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Had two in my bag, offered them, good tactic, goal is to elicit their truth, what they think is the reality in this situation. My goal to make them feel comfortable telling me what they think the truth is, that's one tactice.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Did they take you up on it?</p><p><br></p><p>The one squatting down did.  I'll take one. I pulled it out, cracked it for him, handed it to him.</p>
2021-11-04T15:59:59Z<br><p>Binger:  INdividual with rocks threatening, demonstrate manner in which he was holding rocks?</p><p><br></p><p>Holding it like he was ready to fight, but with rocks. Stepped out in front of other guys, towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  How close did he get to you?</p><p><br></p><p>Probably about 8 feet, I took a step back when he took a step forward, they thought my reactions were funny that I was so scared and so ready to run.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  How do you know they thought it was funny?</p><p><br></p><p>They laughed.  Look at how scared he is. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T16:00:18Z<br><p>Binger:  At that point, whatever intention was gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Did he every throw a rock at you? You were never harmed?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p>
2021-11-04T16:02:02Z<br><p>Binger:  We see end of that video, stop recording while you are talking to those four individuals. How long engaged with them?</p><p><br></p><p>Hostile part maybe 2 minutes, talked for maybe another 3 minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Then?</p><p><br></p><p>Why mad at Rittenhouse, they said we were over there, we were jumping on some cars, and some interaction with Rittenhouse, and then I saw Rittenhouse running, and I had to go. </p>
2021-11-04T16:04:15Z<br><p>Binger:  Saw the defendant running, what did you see?</p><p><br></p><p>Fire extinguisher in one hand, AR in the other. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Next?</p><p><br></p><p>Told hostile guys I had to go, followed Rittenhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Why?</p><p><br></p><p>Fire extinguisher, thought running to event that would be newsworthy. </p>
2021-11-04T16:05:42Z<br><p>Binger:  Then.</p><p><br></p><p>Rittenhouse quite a ways in front of me, called my colleague Shelby, asked where she was, said something like something is about to go down, should make sure we're close to each other. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Phone call to Shelby?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.  Jogging right here, on Sheridan Road just to north of 61st St. I had opened my gas mask bag for the White Claw, hadn't shut it, mask fell out, I picked it up, put in bag, clicked bag, called Shelby. </p>
2021-11-04T16:06:41Z<br><p>Binger: You gave interview said you felt Rittenhouse was running he was drawing attention of the crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>Which interview are you referring to?  I believe I was referring to him shouting medical, and when he was running a lot of people looking in that direction, at that parking lot, dozens if not hundreds of protestors or rioters, when he was running, people directed their attention that way, for sure. </p>
2021-11-04T16:08:38Z<br><p>Binger:  You felt hairy situation, dangerous situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, fire extinguisher and fact he was running, something was about to happen. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  did you also feel that defendant running with AR through this crowd culd cause a problem?</p><p><br></p><p>In my mind, in that moment, I couldn't think of a situation that would necessitate someone running through a fire extinguisher in one hand and weapon in the other, not the way I was taught to handle a weapon in a public place?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Contradiction to have fire extinguisher in one hand, rifle in other?</p><p><br></p><p>Not a contradiction, usually people are serving a role, one role.  Fire extinguisher, or medic, different roles.  </p>
2021-11-04T16:09:11Z<br><p>Binger:  Punk rockers, fire brigade, did they have guns?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Having AR incompatible with being a medic or fire brigade?</p><p><br></p><p>Not incompatible. I don't know what you're getting at. </p>
2021-11-04T16:10:32Z<br><p>Binger:  You left those four individuals when you saw defendant running, you followed, did come a time when you followed and he was no longer running?</p><p><br></p><p>Right about, I was on phone with Shelby, and he slowed down, I was still running to catch up, he did slow and stop, down around where the eventual shooting took place.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Starts running, walks a bit, then starts to run again. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Where were you in relation to the defendant? </p><p><br></p><p>He was, at the moment that he slowed down, I was a half a block back. </p>
2021-11-04T16:11:58Z<br><p>Binger:  When he slowed down, were you still running.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, to catch up to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  When caught up, how close behind him in the end?</p><p><br></p><p>From the point where he slowed down? When I caught up, it was just a moment after that he started running again. At that time I was probably 30 feet back.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  He began running again. Any event that you perceived that attracted your attention at the time he started running.</p><p><br></p><p>A lot of people yelling, screams, N-word, can hear in video the friendly, friendly, Not much decipherable. </p>
2021-11-04T16:14:59Z<br><p>Binger:  We've heard references to friendly friendly. Put yourself back in mindset of that evening. What then?</p><p><br></p><p>Rosenbaum advanced to Rittenhouse, Rittenouse maybe saw him coming, I said at the time a juke, but more like a pivot and a run.</p><p><br></p><p>[So, Rittenhouse desperately fleeing the attacking Rosenbaum.]</p><p><br></p><p>Ran to this lot, Rosenbaum ran after him, and I was behind both of them.</p>
2021-11-04T16:15:04Z<br><p>Binger:  We've heard references to friendly friendly. Put yourself back in mindset of that evening. What then?</p><p><br></p><p>Rosenbaum advanced to Rittenhouse, Rittenouse maybe saw him coming, I said at the time a juke, but more like a pivot and a run.</p><p><br></p><p>[So, Rittenhouse desperately fleeing the attacking Rosenbaum.]</p><p><br></p><p>Ran to this lot, Rosenbaum ran after him, and I was behind both of them.</p>
2021-11-04T16:16:17Z<br><p>Binger: So Rittenhouse in front, Rosenbaum behind, and you are behind Rosenbaum. How far back as you as went through parking lot?</p><p><br></p><p>I was running faster, catching up, initially 30 feet back when running started, but ultimately 15 feet.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You were still behind.</p><p><br></p><p>I did later my trajectory when I saw Rittenhouse turn around, and I saw Rosenbaum lunge for the front of the rifle. </p><p><br></p><p>[!!!]</p>
2021-11-04T16:17:38Z<br><p>Binger:  You appear to be holding up your cell phone during this?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, attempted to record, thought I was, but just took a live photo of the ground. Pressed photo button instead of video.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Thought you were recording video, but were not. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, turned all this over, video did not start until I arrived over Rosenbaum after he was shot.  Wasn't actually looking at the phone at the time. </p>
2021-11-04T16:19:02Z<br><p>Binger:  What was it about situation in front of you, fixated on it, that focused your attention?</p><p><br></p><p>We were running quickly, so focused on that, I knew having seen Rittenhouse earlier, that he was armed, and also there was a bag that was thrown by Rosenbaum, so clearly there was something about to happen, so paying attention to that.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Did you ever see a weapon on Rosenbaum? A gun, a knife, a club, or a bat or a chain?</p><p><br></p><p>Just the bag that was thrown.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T16:20:35Z<br><p>Binger:  As the chase is occurring in Car Source parking lot, did you hear, in that moment, did you hear Rosenbaum say anything? </p><p><br></p><p>There as an F-you.  At the time, in that instant, my recollection of it, the night of, hard for me to tell who yelled that. After seeing the footage very clear to me who yelled it. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger interrupts.  Ha! Doesn't want jury to hear it was Rosenbaum yelling F-you!</p><p><br></p><p>I heard things said, but didn't perceive it coming from him, in that instance there was a pop, and Rittenhouse turned around, and my focus on barrel of weapon.</p><p><br></p><p>[Pop would be the Ziminsky shot.]</p>
2021-11-04T16:21:35Z<br><p>Binger:  You were asked at time if there were words exchanged, you said no.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, no words exchanged, they didn't ask me if I heard Rosenbaum yell something. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger moves on.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Pop sound.</p><p><br></p><p>Just before Rittenhouse turns around and shoots Rosenbaum. </p>
2021-11-04T16:22:37Z<br><p>Binger:  In that moment, did you hear the pop?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, but at that time not clear it was from a gun. It was my understanding that Rittenhouse turned around because he was running into a corner. </p><p><br></p><p>[Trapped]</p><p><br></p><p>At night of, seemed he turned around because reached a dead end. </p><p><br></p><p>[Not helpful to the prosecution.] </p>
2021-11-04T16:26:55Z<br><p>Binger:  Thermal footage on screen. Familiar with it?  Testimony with individual with circle, person of interest #1, Rosenbaum. Square around second, #2, defendant.  You will come into this video behind all of them, you'll recognize yourself, I'll play it so you can see it, pay attention to the movements of the three of you. </p><p><br></p><p>Video plays. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Point out yourself on this IR image.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T16:27:53Z<br><p>I suppose this is Binger attempting to establish foundation for his charge of reckless endangerment re: McGinnis.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, criminal recklessness involves an UNJUSTIFIED creation of risk to life.  Whatever Rittenhouse was doing while defending himself against Rosenbaum's murderous attack would seem to be lawful self-defense, and therefore justified. </p>
2021-11-04T16:31:14Z<br><p>McGinnis: I was continuing, realized they were about to collide, and I altered my trajectory in direction I perceived to be out of harms way.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: What harm?</p><p><br></p><p>Once Rittenhouse turned and Rosenbaum continued, very short time to when the hsots were fired, and in that short time I realized that Rosenbaum mwas continuing to advance, and Rittenhouse was standing still, and they would be based on Rosenbaum, the way he was running, lunging to the front portion of the rifle, it was clear to me that something with the weapon was about to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Something with the weapon was about to happen?</p><p><br></p><p>Not clear if weapon going to be grabbed, or fired, or what, but situation where something dangerous going to happne, Rosenbaum grabbing it, Rittenhouse shooting it, but my eyes were fixated ont he barrel of the weapon, I didn't want to end up on the receiving end of it. </p>
2021-11-04T16:34:05Z<br><p>Binger: Where was barrel pointed?</p><p><br></p><p>When he stopped, about 45 degrees to the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Did angle change?</p><p><br></p><p>When Rosenbaum lunged, raised.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: What was position of Rosenbaum body when defendant fired?</p><p><br></p><p>Lunge to front portion, a dodge around, when he missed, his momentum forward--Rosenbaum--when he did not make contact, not clear to me if made contact, but trajectory of rifle not altered by lunge, but if did make contact just a glance, that's what I was focuse don.  Rosenbaum basically fell forward, like it was, if you lunge at somebody, they'd probably stop themselves, but shots were fired in that exact instance his momentum was moving forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: When Rosenbaum landed on ground, body position?</p><p><br></p><p>Face down. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: When defendant shot Rosenbaum, he was already falling?</p><p><br></p><p>Not falling, his momentum was going forward, and also his hands were out in front of his feet, so his center of gravity is beyond where his feet were. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T16:36:00Z<br><p>Binger: You gave interview where you characterized this as defendant shooting Rosenbaum as he was falling.</p><p><br></p><p>Don't recall specifically saying that. There were four shots. Was that a direct quote? </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Put it up on the screen.</p><p><br></p><p>[Binger is essentially treating McGinnis as a hostile witness.]</p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T16:37:44Z<br><p>Video of interview with Tucker Calrson, McGinnis says on video that Rittenhouse fired shots as Rosenbaum falling forward.</p><p><br></p><p>McGinnis, three days after, that was Friday.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Your memory three days later better than now?</p><p><br></p><p>Just the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Generally, people's memory better closer in time. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: In this video you are telling Fox news that defendant shot Rosenbaum as he was falling foward.</p><p><br></p><p>Unclear to me, shots were so quick, unclear, if he lunged, and shots fired as he was lunging, so perhaps it was the shots that caused him to continue to fall flat.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: That's not what you just said. </p><p><br></p><p>Jeepers. </p>
2021-11-04T16:38:05Z<br><p>Folks, this is why we require the actual witness to take the stand, and don't just allow video statements. </p>
2021-11-04T16:40:57Z<br><p>Binger: Your interview says Rosenbaum already falling forward when the defendant used the gun and discharged the hsots.</p><p><br></p><p>Don't see that as inconsistent with now, Rosenbaum threw his momentum towaords the weapon, and when he missed the weapon, he continued going forward, and that's the point where he fired the shot.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You were saying before not ssure if falling because of the shot. But here in itnerview you are sying falling before the shots.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me clarify, I'm saying I don't know if he didn't catch himself beacuse of the shots. If the shots had not been fired, not clear ot me if he would have fallen or caught himself.</p><p>[</p><p>Binger: Your statement in interview, telling us now, is that Rosenbaum is falling when Rittenhosue shot him.</p><p><br></p><p>I would not say that, I'm not using that word, falling, I'm not saying that.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: But you said it in interview--</p><p><br></p><p>I'm not saying that now.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder interrupts, [to Binger] ask questions, don't tell him what he's saying. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Whatever you want to call it, Rosenbaum was in that motion, lunging, falling, whatever, when the shot was fired.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-04T16:41:28Z<br><p>Breaking for lunch.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, that exchange between Prosecutor Binger and McGinnis was a disaster for the state. </p>
2021-11-04T16:41:34ZLunch Recess<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T17:38:02ZJury being brought back to courtroom<br><p>Presumably, will continue with ADA Binger's disastrous, for the state, direct questioning of STATE witness Richard McGinnis.</p><p><br></p><p>Defense could sit and watch this train wreck continue all day, I expect. </p>
2021-11-04T17:41:52ZContinued direct of McGinnis by ADA Binger<br><p>Binger:  When you saw what was happening, thinking?</p><p><br></p><p>Rittenhouse turned around, Rosenbaum continued to advance, clear based on speed of Rosenbaum running, and shouted beforehand {F-you!} Not coming together for a friendly meeting, I became worried because I was behind Rosenbaum that I didn't want to get hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You felt like you were in the line of fire?</p><p><br></p><p>I did.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  When shots fired, did anything happen to you? Did you get hit?</p><p><br></p><p>Nope.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Did you tell police that night you got hit?</p><p><br></p><p>When shots fired, I did change my I looked down at my legs, difficult for me to say if it was a sound or sensation, but there was a fleeing like something went past my leg, looked down, looked back up. </p>
2021-11-04T17:42:54Z<br><p>Binger: You felt the defendant that you felt something on your leg and you first thought you'd been shot, correct?</p><p><br></p><p>Not sure if something contacted my pants, or just sensation, sound, but it caused me to look down, stamped my legs to be sure OK.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Did you feel defendant's actions of turning around, pointing gun, put you in danger?</p><p><br></p><p>Given where I was, certainly I was in danger, yes. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T17:43:38Z<br><p>Binger:  Rosenbaum actions towards Rittenhouse, clarify that, at any point did you see Rosenbaum touch the defendant's gun?</p><p><br></p><p>Hard for me to say if he actually made contact, what I can say is extremely close, and if he did then it didn't alter the trajectory of the weapon. But very close. </p>
2021-11-04T17:44:35Z<br><p>Binger:  Know from all video, all evidence Rittenhouse fired four rounds, Rosenbaum ends up face down on ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>[NOTE THAT BINGER GAVE UP THE WHOLE, SHOT HIM WHILE ALREADY FALLING LINE.]</p>
2021-11-04T17:46:02Z<br><p>Binger:  Then?</p><p><br></p><p>McGinnis:  Rittenhouse had, from my perspective, run away, and Rosenbaum lying behind car, shots fired at such close range he had to have been hit, saw him lying lifeless, thought to get to safety and to help him, asked are you ok, going to flip you over, then I flipped him over and other people arrived, all on video, I presumed had to be big wounds, looking for those, and somebody shouted hospital across the street, told another person to grab other arm and we carried him across the street, should I just continue?</p>
2021-11-04T17:47:38Z<br><p>Binger:  Play exhibit #19.  Car Source location just as shots about to be fired, chase across Car Source lot. McGinnis holding camera, approaching lot. </p>
2021-11-04T17:48:43Z<br><p>Video: Now Rosenbaum on ground, Rittenhouse making phone call. McGinnis stripping off shirt to attempt to help Rosenbaum. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Is it hard for you to see it.</p><p><br></p><p>Don't like to watch it. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Wanted to show that to you, moment after shooting, taking shirt off, why?</p><p><br></p><p>Presumed given how close they were that he had been hit, and my dad was ER doctor, and if something's bleeding you apply pressure. </p>
2021-11-04T17:50:36Z<br><p>Binger:  Defendant runs around car, and comes close to you, try to come back to that moment in time, in that moment, beside Rosenbaum body, did you know that was defendant?</p><p><br></p><p>I did not. Tunnel vision, looking at Rosenbaum on ground and attempting to find wounds, saw pair of legs, saw hand reach into pocket, assumed that was happening, when I got up, watching video after the fact was facing Rittenhouse, but removing my shirt and actually looking at the ground wasn't until next morning realized it was Rittenhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  If you had known that was Rittenhouse in that moment, would you have felt in danger?</p><p><br></p><p>Felt in danger anyway, might have changed my tone of voice. Can't really imagine what I would have done, but I was afraid in that moment anyway. Hard for me to say. </p>
2021-11-04T17:51:02Z<br><p>Binger:  Individual you sensed, now know the defendant, he pulled out his phone.</p><p><br></p><p>I just saw his hand go into pocket, I said call 911, hand went in pocket, assuemd that was what was happening.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T17:51:14ZOh, boy, signal lost from courtroom. Nice job, Court TV<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T17:52:37Z<br><p>Binger:  I apologize, but I need to show it. </p><p><br></p><p>[McGinnis clearly emotional here ]</p><p><br></p><p>It's video of McGinnis talking to Rosenbaum, who is dying or dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Trying to provide pressure, aid to Rosenbaum.</p><p><br></p><p>Where's the hole? Put pressure! Lots of shouting, chaotic.  </p>
2021-11-04T17:54:14Z<br><p>Binger:  You were recording that video.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Earlier described holding phone up, accidentally not recording video, at what time made the switch?</p><p><br></p><p>No idea, don't know how it went from photo to record, don't know how it started at that moment. I actually called CEO from company and said I had recorded a homicide, and realized then it hadn't been recording at the time.</p>
2021-11-04T17:55:03Z<br><p>Binger:  You testified before, attempted to treat Rosenbaum, then he's carried over to the hospital. Your involvement in that process. </p><p><br></p><p>[None of this has anything to do with any of the criminal charges of legal defenses. It's pure emoting for the jury.]</p>
2021-11-04T17:57:33Z<br><p>Binger:  [speaking very softly] Appears at beginning Rosenbaum had eyes open, was he ever responsive to you?  </p><p><br></p><p>In vehicle, seemed eyes looking at me, kind of rolling back.</p><p><br></p><p>[AFB: I could hear agonal breathing while Rosenbaum on street, which would be last moments of life.]</p><p><br></p><p>McGinnis: He was having difficulty breathing. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Did he say anything at all?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p>
2021-11-04T17:59:37Z<br><p>Binger:  You helped hospital personnel get him on gurney, stay there a while?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, covered in blood, didn't have a shirt, police locked down the hospital, Shelby offered me the shirt off her back so I wouldn't be conspicuous if I tried to leave, then police told me to come to the station.  Cooperating fully with police, stayed at hospital maybe an hour, then squad car came and got me, uniformed police officer asked me some questoins at the hospital, and I gave him my phone. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  See any other folks shot or injured?</p><p><br></p><p>I did, saw Grosskreutz.  </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Where? </p><p><br></p><p>Right after I loaded Rosenbaum no gurney, he came in, Grosskreutz with an officer and he was holding his arm, and I saw his arm.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Saw?</p><p><br></p><p>Bicep was effectively gone, a lot of blood. </p>
2021-11-04T18:00:52Z<br><p>Binger:  [speaking softly] Tell us in your own words how you were feeling in that moment?</p><p><br></p><p>It was surreal. Felt scared about what was going to happen, what I would have to do, I knew what I had seen, I became more worried once I reazlied my phone wasn't recording.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Why do you say that?</p><p><br></p><p>Made me realize it was my eyes that saw it, rather than just being able to show, I'd have to tell. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  LIke doig today.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p><p>That's it for direct of McGinnis.</p>

2021-11-04T18:03:27Z<br><p>Richards:  After you left the hospital, went to Kenosha PD, interviewed by detective. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  You gave them a recorded statement. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  You stated to detective, "the guy who I interviewed was trying to evade him."  Guy is who?</p><p><br></p><p>Rittenhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  He was trying to evade whom?  </p><p><br></p><p>Initially, hard to tell, street was dark, a ways back, there were a number of individuals moving in his direction, a lot of noise, not clear initially.  </p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  But you used the word him, singular.  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, but I also said several individuals including the man who was shot.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  On page 20, there were other people moving quickly two moving quickly, one was the one ended up shot and dying and he [Rittenhouse] was trying to evade those individuals.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:05:03Z<br><p>Richards: Menacing? Circumstances, not Kyle, right?</p><p><br></p><p>When I said menacing, I meant the situation, mostly meant if anything people on roof, couldn't really see them, not so much people on ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: And Kyle was on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Interview with menacing was 26 minutes long, and you used menacing once.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p>
2021-11-04T18:05:58Z<br><p>Richards:  detective interview: Rittenhouse very cordial, very nice, innocent, too much for his own good. </p><p><br></p><p>Mob was casting negative looks at him, pissed off at him, he didn't seem to be aware of that. </p>
2021-11-04T18:06:56Z<br><p>Richards:  Rioters didn't like people with long weapons.</p><p><br></p><p>Fair statement. Also, he was shouting medical, and people were looking at him negatively, angry, when they heard him, and saw his weapon.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  That's where you talked about the duality, a medic having a gun.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  He might not have perceived a problem with that dual role.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, he might not have perceived how others perceived him. </p>
2021-11-04T18:08:18Z<br><p>Richards:  Reading, I don't know if it was the fire extinguisher or piece of metal, I have no idea, bu tthe extinguisher was gone and the AR aiming downwards, and heading into parking lot, kind of facing backwardfs and rosenbaum advancing, he dodged around, ran backwards, describing Rittenhouse running from Rosenbaum.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  As he's running, Rosenbaum in pursuit, Kyle turns in weaopn in downward position towards Rosenbaum. </p><p><br></p><p>Final instance, first instance.  COrrect.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:10:44Z<br><p>Richards:  Rosenbaum continues to chase Rittenhouse?</p><p><br></p><p>Correnct. That's where two individuals chasing him.  </p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Rittenhouse turning around, as Rosenbaum chasing him. </p><p><br></p><p>When turned around initially, Rittenhouse on sidewalk, not yet in lot.  Didnt identify Rosenbaum until entered lot, well lit.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  When enters lot, Kyle and Rosenbaum in that area, nobody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  He ran as far as he could?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I told police that night, when he stopped entered area with car parked and wall, conceivable might have contineud, but it seemed to me, my perception it was a dead end, or felt that way.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  And he turned and looks at Rosenbaum.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Rosenbaum knows he's chasing an armed individual?</p><p><br></p><p>Objection: Speculation.</p>
2021-11-04T18:11:38Z<br><p>Richards:  Rittenhouse turns, has firearm in his hands, Rosenbaum is running towards Kyle.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing between those two individuals, nothing to block Rosenaum view?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Could have stopped, kept advancing.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Continued to advance until lunged for weapon.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p>
2021-11-04T18:12:34Z<br><p>Richards:  You know today Rosenbaum shouted "F-YOU!"</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Tone?</p><p><br></p><p>Very angry.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  There have been claims of Rosenbaum shot in the back.  Did Rosenbaum ever turn his back to Rittenhouse?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: your vantage point would have allowed you to see if this had been the proverbial shooting an innocent person in the back?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-04T18:14:41Z<br><p>Richards:  You never saw Rosenbaum turn away from Rittenhouse, expose is back?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  You to detective that night, in my best estimation, I thought that this individual and others thought they were going to get his gun from him.</p><p><br></p><p>Objection: Speculation.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder you can explore what appeared to him to happen. To Jury: , lawyers need to focus on perception of the senses. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:15:47Z<br><p>Schroeder will allow.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  I thought those individuals thought they were going to take his gun from him.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Based on what? </p><p><br></p><p>The way they were advancing on him. MOving quickly, try to catch him.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Anyone friendly with Rittenhouse at that time?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p>
2021-11-04T18:17:13Z<br><p>McGinnis: Rittenhouse was alone then.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Clear focused on those two that the unarmed guy got shot was trying to get his gun. Remember making that statement?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Based on?</p><p><br></p><p>Motion of Rosenbaum running and reaching for the front portion of the rifle.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  That evening, told the detective, it looked like it was very close. What did that mean?</p><p><br></p><p>I was behind Rosenbaum, and Rittenhouse on other side of Rosenbaum, it was clear that as helunged forward they almost made contact, very close just meaning close enough to just reach out.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Your perception was Rosenbaum was going for the barrel of the gun.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p>
2021-11-04T18:18:16Z<br><p>Richards:  You stated to detective, he was certainly trying to grab the barrel of the gun?</p><p><br></p><p>Objectoin: Speculation.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder allows. </p><p><br></p><p>It was clear to me that he was reaching specifically for the weapon, because that's where his hands went. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:19:57Z<br><p>Richards:  Your statement to detective, yeah, it was like he, the guy he shot was like this, and he leaned in, so he was like this, at time he was shot he was kind of leaning forward. You were describing what you perceived Rosenbaum doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Can you show us?</p><p><br></p><p>McGinis demosnrating. Low running forward position, lunging forward with both hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Attack position, both hands out, and going for the barrel.</p><p><br></p><p>More kind of in an athletic position, like running as fast as you could. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Running as fast as  he could, then showed both yoru arms going out almost like Superman.</p><p><br></p><p>More like out and down, because rifle was aimed lower than hands were, so hands were going downward toaard the barrel.</p>
2021-11-04T18:21:10Z<br><p>Richards:  What does Kyle do?</p><p><br></p><p>Dodge around lunge, level weapon and fire, nto quite level, because Rosenbaum lower done, leveled at this body. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  this exchange with detective: That's the onoly reason I say there were morep eople involved in trying to corner this guy, ehard a lot of yelling and fast movement.  You thought this was a group of people, at least two, trying to get Kyle's gun from him when he was alone.</p><p><br></p><p>I was speculating that's what they were trying to do based on what I saw.</p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:22:05Z<br><p>Richards:  There's a shot, then there's Kyle's shot</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: First shot, behind you to side of you?</p><p><br></p><p>Building to my right, Rosenbaum in front of me, to my left.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  From area of sidewalk.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  You've looked at numerous videos since, see flash of gunfire.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. </p>
2021-11-04T18:24:33Z<br><p>Richards:  Your statement, clear to me buy with gun was tyring to evade the other guy, did  not want to be caught by Rosenbaum.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: And when Kyle turned with gun, Rosenbaum kept advancing.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.[</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Had no oway to know this was a three person grouping, him, Rosenbaum, you.</p><p><br></p><p>Objection, can't know what Kyle knew.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder rephrase.</p><p><br></p><p>To your knowledge did Kyle know you were behind Rosenbaum?</p><p><br></p><p>Objection, same basis. Overruled, then Schroeder hesitates. Need to be phrased in terms of the physical circumstances suggest.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroder is guiding the defense on phrasing!</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Would Rittenhosue have bene in ap osition to know you were behind Rosenbaum?</p><p><br></p><p>He was close enough, but I wasn't looking at where he was looking. It was light in that area, if he had been looking in my direction he would have seen me.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  But running away until he turns and has this guy running at him.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p>
2021-11-04T18:24:54Z<br><p>Richards:  If Rosenbaum h ad stopped 5 or 7 feet away, would he have been shot?</p><p><br></p><p>Objection: Sustained, speculation.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:27:35Z<br><p>Richards:  Shots to Rosenbaum, slow, or quick?</p><p><br></p><p>Very quick. Wasn't even sure of number at the time, that quick.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: What's happening to you as trying to get Rosenbaum to vehicle?</p><p><br></p><p>Very large crowd around lots of yelling, I was getting bumped, and I thought that I was being bumped by the crowd, then harder, a fist hit my face as I loaded him into vehicle.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  So there's a large group of peopel surrounding you, and people in that crowd were striking at you?</p><p><br></p><p>I can only identify the one punch. A lot of adrenaline, thought just bumps, Didnt' really feel it until a hard punch to the side of my face, turned and saw individual, he was pointing at me like he was mad at me. Kicked my legs towards where he was to get him away from me.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:28:41Z<br><p>Richards:  You go to that interview with detective, very interested in your phone.Told they will either take your phone and get search warrant, or you can consent.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Don't want to give up your phone, your livelihood?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Did they tell you they wouldnt go into your phone becacuse of Marcy's law?</p><p><br></p><p>Don't recall anything about Marcy's law.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: They told youf idn't consent, search warrant?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Written a curfew ticket?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p>
2021-11-04T18:29:31Z<br><p>Richards:  At this riot, more firearms than you'd seen elsewhere?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. The most was seattle.  </p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Portland can't open carry or be areested. New York. DC.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Wisconsin you can open carry.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Makes for a prevalence of guns.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, same in Seattle, as well.</p>
2021-11-04T18:30:47Z<br><p>Richards:  Second night of Kenosha, you saw the Car Source lot with all the cars, below your hotel.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, burning every night.  </p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Where all the cars were burned up.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Monday night. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Fire department didn't come? </p><p><br></p><p>I saw fire department respond to a different fire at furniture store, but not that lot.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  And some cars on fire at Car Source two, trying to put out with buckets.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Citizens, not fire department.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p>
2021-11-04T18:32:08Z<br><p>Richards:  You had no fear from Kyle or Balch when you went out with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Feaerful in general sense.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Fearful of them as individuals?</p><p><br></p><p>Fearful of potentiality that those weapons would be used. Elevated in terms of assessment of risk of situation. But not specifically fearful of them individually. Fearful of what might happen,</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Fearful of situation Aug. 25, all the armed peiole, rioting, chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>And the guns.</p><p><br></p><p>That's it for cross of McGinnis.</p>
2021-11-04T18:32:18ZOh my God, Binger is going to re-direct.<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:34:27Z<br><p>Binger:  Exhibit 25. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Heard you testify, let me ask you, fair to say at moment video is paused, you are not yet on the screen. </p><p><br></p><p>Sounds right, just off the screen to the right.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Talked about your perception of defendant and what you believe is going on when he arrived, one or more individuals after him, he's having to evade them.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You were further back, dark, hard to see exactly.</p><p><br></p><p>Sounds like a defense lawyer raising reasonable doubt. </p>
2021-11-04T18:35:40Z<br><p>Binger:  Person interest #1, Rosenbaum. Can you point out the other individual or individuals chasing the defendant chasing him, running after him, that you believe you saw.</p><p><br></p><p>I wouldn't say chasing, directing their attention and moving towards him, not like a dead spring chase.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  However you want to put it, point those people out. </p><p><br></p><p>OK.</p><p><br></p><p>Video plays. McGinnis supposed to pause. </p><p><br></p><p>McGinnis: It's the individuals in the middle of the street.</p>
2021-11-04T18:36:39Z<br><p>Binger:  Do you want us to go back a little bit. </p><p><br></p><p>Crowd in middle of street, by side of sidewalk.</p><p><br></p><p>It's the group in street near group of four cars. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  How many people there are there?</p><p><br></p><p>Eight, ten. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:41:10Z<br><p>Binger:  Play video forward a little.  Rewind 20 seconds. I don't know how to phrase this. Would you be able to  point out other than Rosenbaum that are moving towards the defendant, running after him. I know you said their attention, that could mean many things. But physical movement, any who  moved physicall towards him?</p><p><br></p><p>Can you play it again.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Please try to keep an eye out for us, physical movement towards the defendant.</p><p><br></p><p>OK. These people, not clear to me if advacning in general or towards Rittenhouse, but that's who I was refering to.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Clear that Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse, I thought you saw other people directly going after the defendant? Did you see that?</p><p><br></p><p>Seemed to me they were turning attention to him, shouting at him, not a chase, directing their attention, not a running at him, more like turning their bodies towards him, like that group, seemed to be gravitating towards where he was.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  But already heading in that direction anyway.  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I ran up, was on phone, heard yelling attention.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Would you agree in this video no other figures moving towards defendant?</p><p><br></p><p>If you rewind, it's possible that they are just walking in that direction. </p>
2021-11-04T18:41:44Z<br><p>Binger:  Show us who you believe is moving towards Rittenhouse other than Rosenbaum?</p><p><br></p><p>[Binger is just coming across as argumentative, now. ]</p>
2021-11-04T18:44:15Z<br><p>Binger:  Would you agree they are not moving in direction of defendant?</p><p><br></p><p>They are moving in direction of defendant. And their screaming at defendant. Perhaps they were moving that way anyway, but they were moving that way. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Did any of those folks look back at you as you approached?</p><p><br></p><p>Me specifically, not that I recall.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  In that lot at this moment, folks in the lot, far corner of lot, some parked cars on left, we all known now a large crowed there, bashing the crap out of those cars, windows, doors, we know that with hindsight, were you aware that night at this moment that was happening?</p><p><br></p><p>When on phone with Shelby, she mentioned something going on, windows are breaking, I assume that was the car windows, other than that, no. </p>
2021-11-04T18:46:15Z<br><p>Binger:  Indicated when defendant running, entered a bit of a dead end.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  On the video here, Rittenhouse, Rosenbaum, continue video forward. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  No one else in coordinating with Rosenbaum, corrale defendant, pen him in.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond the screaming and the yelling, walking in his direction? No.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:48:42Z<br><p>Binger:  Video shows defendant, starting to run. Runs into the center of those four cars, that's where the shooting occurs.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: If run through those, huge amount of open space, left bottom of parking lot.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. But a bit of a dead end, not like the cars were snugged up and had to jump over them, but there was enough space to pass through if wanted to. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Area where this all occurs, would you agree well lit?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you mean the final chase.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  In the parking lot where shooting occurs. </p>
2021-11-04T18:50:23Z<br><p>Binger:  You have described your impressions of what Rosenbaum was meaning to do, intending to do, in final physical acts to defendant.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  At any point did you hear Rosenbaum say anything about the gun? I want the gun, I'm going to steal the gun, give me the gun?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't hear anything like that.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  And after shooting Rosenbaum never said a word.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You don't know what Rosenbaum was thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Never exchanged words with im.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Your interpretation is complete guesswork.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, he said F-you and then he reached for the weapon.  OUCH</p>
2021-11-04T18:52:16Z<br><p>Binger:  Defendant has turned, gun in hand, Rosenbaum is getting close.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You testified Rosenbaum reaching for the gun.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Many reasons why someone would reach for gun pointed in their direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Weapon was at a 45 degree angle, I don't know what you're asking if you're asking if there's a reason that he grabbed it?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You gave a reason.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't give any reason.  I just said what he was doing.  I don't know WHY he did what he did, I saw him go for the front portion of the gun, that's what I saw him do.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Front portion, the muzzle.</p><p><br></p><p>Not the tip, grabbing for the front portion of it, the shroud, where he missed was six inches up the weapon.</p>
2021-11-04T18:54:40Z<br><p>Binger:  Rosenbaum in a low position running.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  HOw tall he was?</p><p><br></p><p>Not very tall.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Shorter than defendant. Shorter than you.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You  made a physical gesture, got the gun in his hands, barrel pointed to defendant's left, moves it around, up and over the outstretched hands of Rosenbaum?  Would that be fair to say?</p><p><br></p><p>Aimed at 45 degree angle to the ground, not to the left, in line with Rosenbaum, but at the ground, and then when Rosenbaum lunched the weapon went to his left. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  By doing so, I know you're testified not sure if Rosenbaum actually touched the gun, but Rittenhouse was finally able to get that gun in a position where there wasn't any more risk of Rosenbaum grabbing it, by doing that little manuever? </p><p><br></p><p>At point he dodged around, they were extremely close, so it's not clear to me what would have happened if those shots hadn't been fired. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T18:56:00ZThat's in for McGinnis<br><p>Binger:  Final question. You talked about your feelings accompanying defendant and Balch, your safety being in jeopardy, your primary concern was the guns, made you feel the most unsafe? Would that be accurate?</p><p><br></p><p>Pirorin the evening were peole tryinkg to take my phone, then the other individuals with the brickes, so I would say there's a baseline level of feaer with all those th ings, but the presence of the weaopns elevated my sense of the risk of the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>That's it for McGinnis.</p>
2021-11-04T18:56:09ZAfternoon break, 15 minutes, back at 2:10pm CT<br><p><br></p>

2021-11-04T19:31:49Z<br><p>Binger:  Some of the folks were dressed or equipped like you, what do you mean?</p><p><br></p><p>One guy, plate gear and carrying an AR-15.

Planned to stay past that?</p><p><br></p><p>That is correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  What were you actually intending to do, physically?  </p><p><br></p><p>Stop people from looting and rioting and whatnot. Most protestors trying to control violence, not working, we were more of a deterrent than anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  What were you going to do?</p><p><br></p><p>Tell people to stop. Throughout night proved out we didn't have to do anything, just us being there seemed to work, my intent the whole time, just be there and be seen. </p>
2021-11-04T19:38:10Z<br><p>Binger:  </p><p><br></p><p>We were hearing from potestors that places left unguarded were being targeted.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  If just being there was enough, why AR-15, body armor, handgun?</p><p><br></p><p>Those people could be armed too.

Attached to gas station.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  In business, the gas station.</p><p><br></p><p>Appeared to be in business.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  But not a house or apartment. If damage to building, lit on fire, would that have caused an injury or death to a person?</p><p><br></p><p>If fire spread to residential homes behind it, yes. </p>
2021-11-04T19:40:30Z<br><p>Binger:  Did anyone try to start a fire at that Car Source?</p><p><br></p><p>Later on tried to start a dumpster on fire, then the church next door on fire.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  The dumpster, was in the street.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, they pulled it off the parking lot area of Car Source and pulled it into street.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Lit it onfire in road.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Dustin Colette put that fire out.  </p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p>

Remember saying that?</p><p><br></p><p>I do. </p>
2021-11-04T19:45:15Z<br><p>Binger:  Defendant tell you anything else about himself, qualifications.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Defendant also with you around Car Source, you'd chat about things.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Impression.  </p><p><br></p><p>Seemed a young and impressionable kid, really interested in what I'd done in life, interested in Jason's life, explained some of the stuff he had done, life guard, EMT certified.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Defendant told you he was a certified EMT, 19 years old.</p><p><br></p><p>This is correct.</p>
2021-11-04T19:46:31Z<br><p>Binger:  What id you think about defendant being there that night?</p><p><br></p><p>He had as much right as anybody else to be there?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Seemed properly equipped?</p><p><br></p><p>Seemed a little underequipped and under-experienced, which is why we kind of stayed with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Did you feel like you needed to keep an eye on the defendant.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes and now. As young as he looked, general way he was carrying himself, protestors would have seen that as a weakness and tried to exploit that.</p><p><br></p><p>!!!!!!</p>
2021-11-04T19:47:52Z<br><p>Binger:  You stayed with defendant to keep an eye on him?</p><p><br></p><p>More he picked me.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You spent a lot of evening close with the defendant.</p><p><br></p><p>Fair.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Defendant asked you about your military experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Told him various deployments and what I did when I was there.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Told him when you arrived, a little after 8pm, a little after curfew, scene at that time?</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the cars had been burned out, the building boarded up pretty good, evidence on side of building where people had tried to start it on fire, looked like a war zone, I would say. </p>
2021-11-04T19:49:07Z<br><p>Binger:  Street, a lot of people?</p><p><br></p><p>At the time mostly law enforcement and people like us, occasional group of protestors coming through.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Aware of protests in Kenosha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, could see them up by courthouse.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Most of protestors north of your location, close to courthouse, when you arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Come a time when crowd got closer?</p><p><br></p><p>Before police pushed, some folks came through, most carrying fire extinguishers, said they were putting out fires.</p>

Tell you the plan?</p><p><br></p><p>Right before about 9am, me and Kyle walking down to gas station, female deputy, we're starting to push them down, once that happened going to be on you guys. Then got in her patrol car and left.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Who was that.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't get a name.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  So police were going to move protestors into your area, give you the job of taking care of them. </p><p><br></p><p>She didn't insinuate, just seemed like that was going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Her rank.</p><p><br></p><p>Didn't see any. </p>

2021-11-04T19:52:02Z<br><p>Binger:  first got the Car source, 8 or so, to the push, 1.5 or 2 hours. During that time, where located?</p><p><br></p><p>Most part 59th.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Defendant, too?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Doing?</p><p><br></p><p>Talking. Sometimes protestors would tell us others were setting something on fire, bald guy with a red shirt, and we'd walk over there. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Who is we?</p><p><br></p><p>Mix each time.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Defendant ever go.</p><p><br></p><p>At least once. </p>
2021-11-04T19:53:42Z<br><p>Balch: Three to four suspects breaking out windows on Stella, once we got within 100 yards, they saw us and ran off.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You along with Colette who went over there? Who else?</p><p><br></p><p>Want to say Kyle was with us, and a protestor who had told us about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  No one wants windows broken or fires started, what gave YOU the right to go around and police that area.</p><p><br></p><p>There were members of the community who asked us to go help them.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Who?</p><p><br></p><p>The four protestors.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Were they employed by Stella?</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't ask.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Somebody was up to no good, you decided to go over and stop them?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>

2021-11-04T19:56:47Z<br><p>Balch: Told about a female, two males, trying to start a fire at the church. Saw somebody at front of church, they saw us, they ran off.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  See any more than that one person? What they were doing? Fire? Put out fire?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  I asked you about 8-9:30 or 10 time, you described Stella, St. James, what else were you doing?</p><p><br></p><p>Walking down to 63rd to check it out, people who said they would stay there didn't, so one or two at a time we would check on it, go to Ultimate check on guys there, then come back.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Fair to say people at Ultimate similar to your group?</p><p><br></p><p>That is correct. </p>
2021-11-04T19:57:57Z<br><p>Binger:  Vans with people with melee weapons, you eventually found out they weren't there anymore?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You heard it, or you knew?</p><p><br></p><p>Heard it from discussion.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  When you heard it how many people guarding 59th.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Did you walk down to 63rd? Defendant? What's going on?</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing much going on. Somepeopel there had gon to ultimate.  But melee people had gone.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T19:59:30Z<br><p>Binger:  Fair to say, you felt like part of your responsibility to guard not just 59th but also 63rd Car source.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p>[</p><p>Binger: 8-9:30 or 10, what else doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Mostly just talking to people when they walked by, not really negative encounters, occasional person wanted to debate, occasional person saying something trying to be lit on fire, go check it out, come back.</p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T20:01:22Z<br><p>Binger:  Now police push, 9:30 or 10.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. Started getting the people, the people who wanted to riot started drifting down to us. Shouting insults at us, some back and forth other members of group, I sepent that time trying to calm people down and keep them omving down the steee. Then encounterned people who were more and more aggressive. Cops would push, then back off, then push again, push further south each time.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  These interactions, was defendant present? </p><p><br></p><p>He had one exchange that I saw. Just some random person in the crowd screamed F-you!</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  How did he react to that?</p><p><br></p><p>He said I love you, too, ma'am. </p><p><br></p><p>Somebody in courtroom laughed out loud. !!!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T20:04:26Z<br><p>Binger:  Saw Rosenbaum?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, didn't seem to be with the protestors generally. He was getting agitated, Tall man with him had hangun in his hand with his finger on the trigger, pointed at the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You had AR.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Hand on butt?</p><p><br></p><p>No.  Hand on grip, finger along frame.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  This guy had finger on trigger, why concerned?</p><p><br></p><p>Typically taught not to do that unless ready to shoot. Had anybody bumped into him, would have been sending a round off. Unsafe. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Potential for some tragic accident.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. Or prepared for something. </p>
2021-11-04T20:05:12Z<br><p>Binger:  You had gun bigger and more powerful than his?</p><p><br></p><p>Fair to say.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  How long you owned your AR-15.  </p><p><br></p><p>Many years.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  How often fired?</p><p><br></p><p>10-15 thousand rounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Caliber.</p><p><br></p><p>5.56</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Familiar with term Full Metal Jacket.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Ammo you used?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-04T20:05:30Z<br><p>Binger:  Can you tell us what FMJ are?</p><p><br></p><p>Solid copper jacket around a lead core. Nothing special about it. </p>
2021-11-04T20:06:49Z<br><p>Binger:  Fair to say FMJ from AR-15 has potential to hit what it is shot at, then continue on.</p><p><br></p><p>It can.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  As opposed to hollow point and stops.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Fair to say, Glock handgun, like you had, is often loaded with hollowpoint, and AR-15 is often loaded with FMJ?</p><p><br></p><p>Depends on intended use. </p>
2021-11-04T20:07:05Z<br><p>Balch is a comeptitive shooter. </p><p><br></p><p>AR is for competition. </p><p><br></p><p>Glock is for defense. </p>
2021-11-04T20:07:57Z<br><p>Binger: Glock with hollowpoint better for self-defense?</p><p><br></p><p>For concealed carry?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: What about open carry?</p><p><br></p><p>Open carry for a glock, yeah. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Range on AR?</p><p><br></p><p>550 yards.</p>
2021-11-04T20:09:34Z<br><p>Binger: You described Rosenbaum, he's shouting F-you at protestors, what else did you see him do.</p><p><br></p><p>Any time I encountered Rosenbaum he was hyper-aggressive and acting out in a violent manner, and always having to be restrained by someone.  </p>
2021-11-04T20:11:02Z<br><p>Binger:  Did you ever see Rosenbaum actually hurt someone?</p><p><br></p><p>I saw him attempt.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You personally have any interaction?</p><p><br></p><p>I got between Rosenbaum and Colette, at one point, and then he threatend me and the defendant.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Was the defendant present for that?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Tell us about that.</p><p><br></p><p>Colette had stopped him from setting something on fire. </p>
2021-11-04T20:11:58Z<br><p>Balch: I tried to calm everything down, said I get what you're trying to do, but not his, Rosebaum right in my face, yelling and screaming. I told him, chill, I don't knwo what your problem is, if I catch any of you guys alone tonight, I'm going to f'ing kill you. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Said it to defendant, too.</p><p><br></p><p>Defendant was there. </p>
2021-11-04T20:14:32Z<br><p>Binger:  Did Rosenbaum reach for your rifle? Your pistol? You?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Could you see he had no weapons?</p><p><br></p><p>He had a bag that looked to be full of chemicals, the guy with a handgun with a backpack behind him, and the woman with the backpack, considered them a group.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Could you see inside the bag?</p><p><br></p><p>Clear hospital type bags, containers, made assumption it was for Molotov cocktails.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Was that actually true?  </p><p><br></p><p>I saw a similar bag later in the night that did not contain those chemicals.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  What you mean is after the defendant shot Rosenbaum, in that incident Rosenbaum throws that same bag, and it is left lying on the ground, and left on ground of Car source. Did you go there after defendant killed Rosenbaum, see the bag, look inside, any Molotov cocktail.</p><p><br></p><p>No, had bottles with soap, but I'd seen plenty of people carying incognito bottles to carry stuff in.</p>
2021-11-04T20:16:24Z<br><p>Binger:  Ingredients for something harmful.</p><p><br></p><p>I didn't look into it, picked it up and tossed it on the ground. No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Felt safe enough to walk up and pick it up?</p><p><br></p><p>Fair.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-04T20:17:20Z<br><p>Binger:  9:30 - 10, police pushing protestors back, kind of came back and forth, fair?</p><p><br></p><p>Fair.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Show on map, police moving protestors back on street, pushing them south on Sheridan from 58 to 59, then 60th. Then police pull back--north of 59th? Protestors cleared from your area, then allowed to come back, and back and forth.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-04T20:18:31Z<br><p>Binger:  When those movements would occur, interactions with folks on the street, what was the general attitude to you and your group.</p><p><br></p><p>Most seemed indifferent.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  </p><p><br></p><p>Some seemed really angry, others seemed happy to stand around and talk.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Remember issue with laser pointers?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, somebody in the crowd pulled out a laser pointer and doing the same thing, to me kind of null.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Any laser sight on your gun?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p>
2021-11-04T20:19:57Z<br><p>Binger:  Know who on roof had laser pointer?</p><p><br></p><p>No idea.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Recall speaking with person taking video for news, rundownlive.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember him coming into area, wasn't an interview so much as him just standing around talking to us.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember dumpster fire during that, he said staying on your property as opposed to going on the street?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  What did you think about that.</p><p><br></p><p>We were already dragging hurt people out of the street, he seemed to want to keep us out of the street, but by that point there really was no declination between Car Source and the street. </p>
2021-11-04T20:21:03Z<br><p>Binger:  I understand you wanting to go out and help people, did you think to yourself, we can stay here to protect this problem, but not our job to police the neighborhood, that occur to you?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You felt you were free to confront people who were doing things wrong.;</p><p><br></p><p>No. Not confront people because I can, if somebody in the crowd asked us to help them, we would.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You weren't just going to rush into a situation?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. </p>

When I ran up a couple of protestors by him ran off, I rolled him over, checked for pulse, didn't feel one, but just a split second check, then a BearKat pulled up.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: What did they do?</p><p><br></p><p>Climbed out, they took him, I gathered up his stuff on the ground, helped them load him up.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Next?</p><p><br></p><p>I continued south.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
