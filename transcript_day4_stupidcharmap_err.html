2021-11-05T15:49:52Z<br><p>Binger:  Ever receive a report that you and others at 59th needed to go down to 63rd to put out a fire or deal with property damage?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  So you went only because you heard gunshots?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  FBI statement what you heard the FBI say?  Sept. 1, 6 or 7 days after the incident?  Was your memory of what occured fresher at that time than today?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  FBI identified selves as law enforcement? There to question you? Know two people had been killed? Feel that you had responsibility to cooperate?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Wanted to be as open and honest as possible?  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-05T15:50:31Z<br><p>This Binger line of argument that Rittenhouse lied about shooting Rosenbaum is ridiculous--in that same moment, he was running to the police line with his hands in the air. </p>

2021-11-05T15:53:03Z<br><p>Binger:  Did he appear to be in the company of other people?</p><p><br></p><p>There were people around him, not sure if they were associated with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Shown a photograph, marked exhibit #14, asked to identify Rosenbaum, and person behind him--know any idea who that is?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Recall seeing that person the night?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p>

2021-11-05T15:55:41Z<br><p>Binger:  Were those two people around with Rosenbaum when he was stepping at you and saying the things he was saying?</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I recall.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You characterized Rosenbaum as most aggressive person that night.  Ever see him physically harm anyone? Ever hear him threaten to harm anyone. Ever see anyone that night physically harm anyone else.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  You walked past Ultimate Gas Station, where in timeline did that occur?</p><p><br></p><p>Right when I got there. Had parked vehicle one street over, then I walked up, 60th I think.</p>
2021-11-05T15:57:35Z<br><p>Binger:  You heard words, "Get him," any other specific words?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  At that moment, when you heard that, who did you think the him was?</p><p><br></p><p>Not too sure. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Was it obvious that the him was the defendant?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  At that moment, did you have any erason to believe defendant had shot anyone?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  That when people shouting, they were meaning Rittenhouse?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>That's it for Binger.</p>

Have all seen case where people hold back and save their questions for re-direct or re-cross, but haven't seen that here, so not going to sway from my usual practice of allowing out of scope.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi:  Have you looked at statement since you gave it, ever read it?</p><p><br></p><p>A few days ago, and now in court.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi:  Who had you read statement?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: I did.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge: Is this his statement, or written by the FBI saying what you told them? It's that.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi:  What Kyle said to you, does it make more logical sense to you today, and he can shake his head if he wants, does it make more sense sitting here now, why would he need help if he didn't shoot someone.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Argumentative.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi:  OK.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You didn't think the get him was about Rittenhouse?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You didn't think he shot anybody because he said he didn't shoot anybody?  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>That's it for Lackowski. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

2021-11-05T16:48:52Z<br><p>Kraus: Have you known Huber to run to danger?</p><p><br></p><p>Objection.  Sustained, certainly on second ground, habit and custom evidence.</p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: We've heard nothing but habit and custom evidence in this case.</p><p><br></p><p>Kraus gets argumentative with Judge Schroeder, Judge Schroeder does not like it. Not one bit. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge:  You don't need to comment on my rulings.  Let's take a break. </p><p><br></p><p>Court in recess until 12:30pm CT. </p>
2021-11-05T16:54:38Z<br><p>Jury out of courtroom. </p><p><br></p><p>Parties arguing about this "nice boy Huber" evidence the state is trying to get into evidence via Susan Hughes </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: Our theory is that these people were trying to stop Rittenhouse, they were provoked by Rittenhouse, and Huber was a hero, we are rebutting that he was aggressively pursuing Rittenhouse with no basis. Rebuttting defense claim that Huber as the initial aggressor. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge: With respect to Rosenbaum, the defense has definitely suggested and presented evidence that Rosenbaum was a turbulent personality, but in terms of Huber, I didn't hear a similar attack on Huber. What defense has offered with respect to Huber is direct evidence that Huber did actions that the jury can just see in the video, see the action, so the evidence is character evidence not directly rebutting the physical acts that the jury has been able to observe.</p>
2021-11-05T16:56:44Z<br><p>Judge Schroeder: I'll think about it during the break. But my initial suspicion is that this doesn't rebut the acts which the jury is able to see. And the statute makes reference to offered by the prosecution in a homicide case to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-05T16:56:46Z<br><p>AFB: I don't really see the point of arguing over this--no matter what the great-aunt says, about how nice Huber was, he still was the initial aggressor.</p><p><br></p><p>AFB: Doesn't matter what Huber's thoughts were, either--all that matters is what Rittenhouse reasonably perceived, not what Huber's motivation might have been. </p>
2021-11-05T16:57:49Z<br><p>WHY Huber attacked Rittenhouse is irrelevant to Rittenhouse self-defense case. </p><p><br></p><p>Defense should be raising a relevance claim.  </p><p><br></p><p>Defense team should have given me their text number. :-)</p>
2021-11-05T17:07:12Z<br><p>State wants Huber aunt to say nice things about it, purportedly to show he was not first aggressor. That's silly, obvious on video he's first aggressor.</p><p><br></p><p>Real reason: Their narrative that Huber a hero stopping active shooter.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>But Huber's motive is irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>
2021-11-05T17:07:21Z<br><p>In self-defense, doesn't matter if the aggressor has a good motive for being the initial aggressor. Their motive is irrelevant.</p><p><br></p><p>What matters is the DEFENDER's reasonable perception of events. And #KyleRittenhouse perception is he's being attacked by a lunatic with a skateboard.</p>
2021-11-05T17:11:37Z<br><p>I hope when the court comes back from lunch the defense knows enough to make the argument that Huber's motive for attacking #KyleRittenhouse is irrelevant to the legitimate legal arguments in this case, &amp; the State should be prohibited from referencing Huber's motive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I hope.&nbsp;</p>
2021-11-05T17:14:43Z<br><p>If the defense allows the state to advance this "Huber was a hero stopping active shooter #KyleRittenhouse," the entire trial will have devolved into fantasy story-telling completely unmoored from the relevant legal principles being charged and defended.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Let's hope not.&nbsp;</p>
2021-11-05T17:37:54Z<br><p>You know what's NOT relevant to a legal defense of self-defense?</p><p><br></p><p>That the person you're otherwise lawfully defending yourself against has good motives for attacking you.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>If the #KyleRittenhouse defense allows this argument by the State, it's a travesty.</p>
2021-11-05T17:43:29Z<br><p>Here we go, Judge Schroeder to rule on objection.</p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: Just so the court knows where we're going, talk about a specific incident when he was a child, ran to try to stop an explosion at a family gather. Not a general, good guy, specific act to rebut that Huber was going to attack Kyle Rittenhouse versus trying to save people from Kyle Rittenhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>Defense: Not a character trait for peacefulness. But if comes in, then allow court specific instances to rebut. Two criminal complaints where Huber caused physical harm to people. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-05T17:43:44Z<br><p>Well, nobody made the correct argument.</p><p><br></p><p>This is awful. </p>
2021-11-05T17:45:21Z<br><p>Well, #KyleRittenhouse defense completely dropped the ball on this, failed to point out that Huber's motive for attacking Kyle is irrelevant to Kyle's self-defense justification, or any other issue in this case.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Terrible.</p>
2021-11-05T17:47:46Z<br><p>The proper argument for the #KyleRittenhouse defense is not just that this particular piece of evidence about Huber's motive for attacking Kyle is irrelevant.</p><p><br></p><p>The proper argument is that the ENTIRETY of Huber's motive is irrelevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Jeepers, counsel, step up.</p>
2021-11-05T17:59:11Z<br><p>State decides to withdraw the question and not illicit the testimony about Huber being a nice boy who saved family gathering from explosion.</p><p><br></p><p>Defense was prepared to rebut with criminal complaint where Huber held knife to brother's neck, threatened to gut him like a fish for not cleaning his room, and threatened to burn down the household "with all you f'ers inside."</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-05T18:00:01Z<br><p>Well, that gives the defense some breathing space to realize what their ACTUAL argument should be on the ENTIRETY of the "Huber as hero stopping active shooter Rittenhouse" narrative the state wants to push--that it's entirely irrelevant to any legal issue in this case. </p>

2021-11-05T18:08:53Z<br><p>Note that this state witness, Rosenbaum "fiance" was the woman who had a restraining order against him the night of Aug. 25th, which is why he was wandering the streets of Kenosha attacking children rather than sitting at home with his "fiance."&nbsp;</p>
