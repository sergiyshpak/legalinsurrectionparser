2021-11-09T16:08:12Z<br><p>Kraus: What is stippling?</p><p><br></p><p>More than bullet comes out of gun. Unburned powder, soot, etc. We look for evidence on body that allows us to estimate distance of muzzle to surface of body. </p><p>On contact wound, muzzle stamp. Out to a certain distance soot, after a foot or so, no soot.</p>
2021-11-09T16:09:16Z<br><p>Kelley: Gun powder stippling: Gun powder can hit skin, call small scrapes, round punctate injuries, surround perforation of bullet. The closer, more dense, as travel through air spread out and create less dense pattern, until point you can't see them anymore. </p><p><br></p><p>Intermediate range</p>
2021-11-09T16:10:39Z<br><p>Kraus: In your report, what is "pseudo" stippling?</p><p><br></p><p>Anything can leave a mark on body, if something other than gunpowder hits skin, creates those abrasions, if bullet goes through another body part, window, the particles of those surfaces might stipple. </p>

2021-11-09T16:13:06Z<br><p>Kelley: This gunshot wound has gunpowder stippling, not surrounding entrance wound, above the abdomen, but because he's wearing clothing over surface of wound, but lower abdomen was exposed. </p><p><br></p><p>Intermediate range. </p>
2021-11-09T16:13:46Z<br><p>Kraus: What is intermediate range?</p><p><br></p><p>Depends on weapon, ammo. Typically gunpowder stippling, muzzle to target of a few feet. Depends on handgun, rifle. </p><p><br></p><p>In this instance, something within a few feet, within four feet. </p>
2021-11-09T16:14:29Z<br><p>Kraus: That's knowing defendant fired with AR, .223?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>He was four feet away?

2021-11-09T17:09:08Z<br><p>Richards: No Stippling along pinkie edge of hand?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richard: So barrel if not touching along palm of hand. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p><p>Richard: Hand was over the barrel of gun when hand shot?</p><p><br></p><p>That makes sense. </p>

2021-11-09T17:11:01Z<br><p>Richards: Put circle where you see soot.  </p><p><br></p><p>Kelley does.</p><p><br></p><p>You put the circle on the ring finger, leaving the baby finger uncircled and blank, because no soot there. </p><p><br></p><p>Correct. </p>

2021-11-09T17:13:15Z<br><p>Richards: Wound in back, anatomical position, as I'm standing straight in front of you.  The wound enters his back, and goes down and across.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: We're not saying that he was turned and shot in the back, correct?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. </p>
2021-11-09T17:13:49Z<br><p>Richards: Nothing in hand shot that suggests hand up in surrender?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Close horizontal position to my client, position of lunging?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. </p>
2021-11-09T17:14:36Z<br><p>Richards: Stippling in wound to pelvis.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, abdomen.</p><p><br></p><p>Starts at belt line and goes up. Because was wearing pants.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. </p>
2021-11-09T17:14:38Z<br><p>Richards: That was gunpowder stippling, one foot to four feet.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-09T17:15:15Z<br><p>Richards: The wound on Huber, at some point you pulled off the bandage [chest seal]. Stippling on that wound?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>What kind?</p><p><br></p><p>Gunpowder stippling. Dense distribution. </p>
2021-11-09T17:15:57Z<br><p>Richards: Did you look at clothing of Huber? Also gunpowder residue?</p><p><br></p><p>Hard to say, tanktop was tie-dyed, black and white, so very difficult. Usually defer than try to opine for sure. </p>
2021-11-09T17:16:34Z<br><p>Richards: Nothing in Huber wound suggests NOT in close contact?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Client on my back, pulls rifle?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>

2021-11-09T17:19:19Z<br><p>Richards: Muzzle in contact?</p><p><br></p><p>Intermediate, within four feet, know from video less than that, but can't say in contact. </p>
2021-11-09T17:19:38Z<br><p>Richards: Video evidence establishes closer than four feet.</p><p><br></p><p>It does. </p>
2021-11-09T17:20:25Z<br><p>Richards: With Rosenbaum, assume for this question, first shot is zero time, fourth shot is 0.76 seconds.  He goes from furthest four feet to touching the gun. Correct?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Objection: Calls for speculation.</p><p><br></p><p>Overruled. </p>
2021-11-09T17:21:10Z<br><p>Holy cow, the State's own medical examiner is blowing up their theory of the case. </p><p><br></p><p>ADA Kraus repeatedly objecting to medical examiner's questions, Dr. Kelley is answering favorably to defense. </p>
2021-11-09T17:21:43Z<br><p>Richards: Shot to pelvis is first?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Head is next?</p><p><br></p><p>No, head and back are third and fourth, horizontal. </p>
2021-11-09T17:22:05Z<br><p>Richards: If I was charging like a bull, and diving, that would be consistent?</p><p><br></p><p>It would be.</p><p><br></p><p>Oofah. </p>
2021-11-09T17:22:43Z<br><p>ADA Kraus re-direct of Dr. Kelley, medical examiner.</p><p><br></p><p>State has to rehabilitate their own medical examiner witness. </p>
2021-11-09T17:23:21Z<br><p>Kraus: Injuries could be consistent with falling?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: What is muzzle stamp?</p><p><br></p><p>Muzzle can leave abrasion on skin, contact gunshot wound.</p>
2021-11-09T17:24:08Z<br><p>Kelley: Skin of palm much thicker, very seldom allows for a muzzle stamp, not like with a contact wound to head or chest.</p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: No muzzle stamp in this case.</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>AFB: Well, Kelley just explained WHY. </p>
2021-11-09T17:25:26Z<br><p>Kraus: If this is the gun, holding rifle, I've shot you in the hip, how does it make sense that gunshot of hand occurs in trajectory you indicated?</p><p><br></p><p>Kelley out of seat, demonstrating--but behind monitor, obscured. </p>
2021-11-09T17:25:28Z<br><p><span style="color: rgb(15, 20, 25);">Can't see what Kelley is doing here. He's obscured by monitor. </span></p>
2021-11-09T17:27:30Z<br><p>Kraus: Could that be consistent with swiping barrel away?</p><p><br></p><p>Can't tell you that. Can only tell you at time of discharge, this is trajectory.  Can't see that on video. </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-09T17:28:06Z<br><p><span style="color: rgb(15, 20, 25);">Poor Medical Examiner Doug Kelley looks so uncomfortable as ADA Kraus tries to compel him to give testimony he doesn't really believe. </span></p>
2021-11-09T17:29:05Z<br><p>Kraus: Could holding something in hand effect pattern of stippling?</p><p><br></p><p>Intermediary item, should.</p><p><br></p><p>So Richards says no soot in a place, if he was holding handle or something--</p><p><br></p><p>Objection: Speculation, no evidence of any kind he had anything in his hand. </p>

2021-11-09T17:30:47Z<br><p>Kelley: Can't see what's in front of him on video, so feel like I can't answer those questions, don't want to over-evaluate that video for more than I used it for, which was position when gunshot wounds received. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge to State: Re-phrase your question. </p>
2021-11-09T17:31:12Z<br><p>Kraus: Injury in left hand, consistent with nothing in hand?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-09T17:31:44Z<br><p>Kraus: Exhibit 41, that's the video you reviewed?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Composite video of Rosenbaum pursuit of Kyle, Kyle shooting Rosenbaum. </p>
2021-11-09T17:32:09Z<br><p>Kraus: Can you see there where positioned for first shot?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, light on his back, upright when first shot heard. </p>
2021-11-09T17:32:40Z<br><p>Kraus: So first shot not consistent with shot to hand.</p><p><br></p><p>No, would affect gunpowder stippling to lower abdomen. </p>
2021-11-09T17:33:03Z<br><p>Kraus: So consistent that first shot to hip, and second shot to hand, and third and fourth in horizontal position?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-09T17:34:38Z<br><p>Kraus: Exhibit 86.  Video, pause. Dr. see large amount of smoke emitted from gun?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Would that impact how far the stippling would occur?</p><p><br></p><p>No.  </p><p><br></p><p>AFB: SMOKE is NOT what causes stippling.</p>
2021-11-09T17:35:10Z<br><p>For God's sake, ADA Kraus is RAISING reasonable doubt.  </p><p><br></p><p>That's the DEFENSE job.  </p><p><br></p><p>REEKS of desperation. </p>
2021-11-09T17:35:51Z<br><p>Kelley: Smoke does not cause stippling, doesn't have energy. </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: The smoke is soot?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Large amount of soot, could deposit further out than a few inches?</p><p><br></p><p>Can't answer that question.  Test fire the weapon. </p>
2021-11-09T17:36:43Z<br><p>Kelley: Soot is not very aerodynamic, doesn't travel very far. Would need to test fire weapon.</p><p><br></p><p>AFB: There's a reason the State has not done this. A: They wouldn't like the answer they got. </p>
2021-11-09T17:37:15Z<br><p>Kraus: You haven't seen the actual weapon, have you?</p><p><br></p><p>Kelley: No, I have not. </p><p><br></p><p>State is now IMPEACHING it's OWN Medical Examiner testimony. Jeepers. </p>
2021-11-09T17:38:01Z<br><p>Kraus: I'm going to ask the deputy to point the gun at me.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge: Check it again! Check it again!</p><p><br></p><p>AFB: This is insane. No need for this.  Could separate the upper and do this safely. </p>
2021-11-09T17:38:36Z<br><p>Kraus: Is this four feet?</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Objection, I'll get a ruler, that's more than four feet.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge: Looks like it's more than four feet to me. </p>
2021-11-09T17:38:58Z<br><p>That's it for re-direct of Kelley.</p><p><br></p><p>Re-cross by Richards. </p>
2021-11-09T17:39:21Z<br><p>Richards: The soot is within inches?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Gunpowder stippling within four feet?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-09T17:40:06Z<br><p>Richards: If zero shot is first shot, say this is about four feet?</p><p><br></p><p>A little further than four feet.</p><p><br></p><p>So the furthest is four feet, could have been as close as here with first shot?</p><p><br></p><p>Possibly, but the density of gunpowder spread out. </p>

2021-11-09T17:45:27Z<br><p>Kraus: Consistent if I'm approaching Detective, struck in my hip, fracture my hip, that I would fall, reach out with my hand and try to knock the gun away?</p><p><br></p><p>Possibility. </p><p><br></p><p>Consistent with the evidence as my hand is now?</p><p><br></p><p>No, need to move hand over. </p><p><br></p><p>AFB: Oofah. </p>

2021-11-09T21:24:30Z<br><p>Schroeder: Wasn't there evidence of Rosenbaum saying I just got out of jail? You have witness who heard that?</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: Object. First think that's hearsay. </p>
2021-11-09T21:26:05Z<br><p>Judge: If this is witness recollection, not for me to censor the evidence. You can cross-examine.  </p><p><br></p><p>Judge:  Didn't witness say jail?</p><p><br></p><p>AFB: Witness had already said something about believing bag from jail. </p>
2021-11-09T21:26:30Z<br><p>Judge loses patience with Kraus.</p><p><br></p><p>Objection overruled, ask the jury to come back in, please. </p>
2021-11-09T21:27:34Z<br><p>Richards: Hear Rosenbaum say anything about bag?</p><p><br></p><p>That he's not afraid to go back to jail.</p><p><br></p><p>You told detective that on Sept. 11, 2020?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. </p>

A</p><p><br></p><p>FB: Hahaha!</p>
2021-11-09T21:30:00Z<br><p>Richards: Did topic of chain come up in your interview with law enforcement?</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I recall.</p><p><br></p><p>If in police report, you would not dispute?</p><p><br></p><p>I would not. </p>
2021-11-09T21:30:45Z<br><p>This witness is completely competent, but has a notable speech impediment.</p><p><br></p><p>Wonder if it will hinder how aggressive State is on cross. </p>
2021-11-09T21:31:25Z<br><p>Richards: You know who person running is now?</p><p><br></p><p>Kyle Rittenhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: What direction running? </p><p><br></p><p>He's running south. </p>

How far were  you?</p><p><br></p><p>Someone ran up and hit Kyle with skateboard, and hit him in neck, and skateboard flew off to the side. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Did that knock Kyle to the ground?</p><p><br></p><p>Objection, leading. </p>
2021-11-09T21:35:17Z<br><p>Richards: Tell us what you saw.</p><p><br></p><p>He stumbled, everything happened in like a second, Kyle on the ground, he turned, released one shot and hit Huber in the chest. As Huber trying to subdue Kyle, hit him with skateboard in neck and head area.</p>
2021-11-09T21:36:19Z<br><p>Richards plays video of Huber striking Kyle. </p><p><br></p><p>Shots at jump kick man, shot at Huber. </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-09T21:37:07Z<br><p>What did you see when Kyle on ground?</p><p><br></p><p>One man trying to hop on him and take gun, and the other was hesitant of approaching him, but then Kyle followed shot and hit Huber.</p><p><br></p><p>Then?</p><p><br></p><p>Gaige took steps forward to Kyle with gun, and Kyle shot him. </p>
2021-11-09T21:38:17Z<br><p>Richards: Did he have something in his hand?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Gaige had gun in his hand.  </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: Ask witness to use formal mode of address. </p><p><br></p><p>AFB: What a whiner. </p>
2021-11-09T21:38:39Z<br><p>Richards: How far were they from where you were?</p><p><br></p><p>Under three feet. </p>
2021-11-09T21:39:17Z<br><p>Richards: You were initially subpoenaed by the State?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Met with Binger and Kraus?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Tension in that room?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-09T21:40:08Z<br><p><span style="color: rgb(15, 20, 25);">Witness: I was called into DA office, sat at a table, handed my police statement, read it over, asked if I would like to add anything, said I would not. Binger pulled out cellphone of video and photo which was one I brought today, and asked if I knew who person was in photo. </span></p>
2021-11-09T21:41:15Z<br><p><span style="color: rgb(15, 20, 25);">Witness: Binger asked if I knew this person, I didn't know, he told me it was Joshua Ziminiski. Then he picked up phone asked me to look at picture, asked me who it was, I said knowing now Joshua Ziminski. He asked me if I wanted to change statement. </span></p>
2021-11-09T21:41:45Z<br><p>Witness:  Binger asked me if I wanted to change statement, I said no.</p><p><br></p><p>Next?</p><p><br></p><p>I got a lawyer. </p>
2021-11-09T21:42:23Z<br><p>Kraus on cross of Witness. </p><p><br></p><p>Said there was tension. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>We didn't ask you to change statement?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you did. </p><p><br></p><p>AFB: Oofah. </p>
2021-11-09T21:43:13Z<br><p>Witness: You asked me if I wanted to change my statement and add Joshua Ziminski. </p><p><br></p><p>We're also prosecuting Ziminski for arson.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently.  At the time I didn't know who he was. </p>
2021-11-09T21:44:19Z<br><p>Kraus: Your statement is that the State in the trial against Rittenhouse wanted you to offer incriminating evidence against Ziminski.</p><p><br></p><p>I don't know what he wanted, I thought it odd, too. </p><p><br></p><p>Were you confused?</p><p><br></p><p>No, Binger was pretty clear. </p>
2021-11-09T21:44:42Z<br><p>Kraus: That was end of the meeting? </p><p><br></p><p>As I recall.</p><p><br></p><p>You remember I complemented you on your photography?</p><p><br></p><p>That was in the beginning. </p>
2021-11-09T21:45:44Z<br><p>Kraus: The discussion of changing statement, did we ask you to re-type it?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>So what do you mean? </p><p><br></p><p>You said do I want to add something. </p><p><br></p><p>You understood that we would re-do statement?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-09T21:46:47Z<br><p>Witness: I was uncomfortable with your request to change my statement. </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus:  You're changing statement right now?</p><p><br></p><p>My recollection refreshed here from videos.</p><p><br></p><p>Kraus:  How is that different than with Binger? </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-09T21:47:38Z<br><p>Kraus: Nobody asked you to write a new statement.</p><p><br></p><p>Not to write. To add, alter.  Way Mr. Binger wanted it, was to add on to my statement physically, Richards just took notes. </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: Did someone ask you to type?</p><p><br></p><p>Just telling you how I see it. </p>
2021-11-09T21:49:26Z<br><p>Oh my God, Kraus is going hard after the kid with the speech impediment, it's bullying the witness at this point, and the witness gives absolutely zero Fs. </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-09T21:50:11Z<br><p>Court recesses for afternoon break. </p><p><br></p><p>But Judge hears objections. </p><p><br></p><p>Defense speculation: He's asking what he knows about somebody else's bias.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge to State: What's that mean? </p>
2021-11-09T21:50:45Z<br><p>Man, Richards and Chirafisi are 100% smiles right now. </p>
2021-11-09T21:55:57Z<br><p>Rumored:&nbsp;Balch, Lackowski, Black, &amp; Rittenhouse offer to protect ADA Kraus from absolutely brutal beating he's taking cross-examining this witness with the speech impediment.</p><p><br></p><p>Asked about protecting Binger on cross of the little old lady, they replied, Nah.&nbsp;</p>
2021-11-09T21:59:52Z<br><p><span style="color: rgb(15, 20, 25);">Looks like we're coming back into session. </span></p>
2021-11-09T22:01:55Z<br><p>Kraus: Blogger approached you?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: How did he find out you had something to say?</p><p><br></p><p>He was at my attorney's office. </p>
2021-11-09T22:02:32Z<br><p>Kraus: You know this blogger and your lawyer have a close business relationship/</p><p><br></p><p>I do not. </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: So why did you talk to him?</p><p><br></p><p>He's media. </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: You talk to all media?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p>
2021-11-09T22:03:16Z<br><p>Kraus: Do you know blogger has written many articles critical of my office?  Wants Rittenhouse found not guilt?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge: Not relevant. </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: My last question on that topic. </p>
2021-11-09T22:03:58Z<br><p>Kraus: Would you describe your meeting with Binger and Kraus as cordial and uneventful?</p><p><br></p><p>Witness: Except for being made to feel uneasy?</p><p><br></p><p>AFB: Hahahahahahahaha! </p>
2021-11-09T22:05:29Z<br><p>Kraus:  Recognize your statement?  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, 9/11/2020, my statement to police. </p><p><br></p><p>You do not mention Rosenbaum having to be held back.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a homicide detective over at my house. </p>
2021-11-09T22:06:27Z<br><p>Kraus: Your memory was better then than now?</p><p><br></p><p>About the same.  </p><p><br></p><p>So why did you forget to put that in your statement?</p><p><br></p><p>Police station had no door, glass on floor, you had me rushed.  </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-09T22:07:35Z<br><p>Kraus: Your explanation for why your statement left things out is you walked through door w/o window?</p><p><br></p><p>No, all around businesses destroyed, I was threatened numerous times out taking photos, uneasy with people still standing outside police station, knowing I'd have to walk out.</p>
2021-11-09T22:08:16Z<br><p>Kraus: So fact no window in police station meant you could not give accurate statement?</p><p><br></p><p>I did not say that. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge to Kraus: He did NO say that. Those are your words. </p>
2021-11-09T22:09:49Z<br><p>Kraus:  In your statement, no mention of Rosenbaum having to be held back.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: No mention of shoot me n-words?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Because you saw on video later?  </p><p><br></p><p>I heard him say it. </p>
2021-11-09T22:10:35Z<br><p>Kraus is doing himself absolutely no favors here. </p><p><br></p><p>Damning this witness for not putting "shoot me n-word" in statement, but we all know it's true.</p><p><br></p><p>Suggests other stuff not in statement can also be true. </p>
2021-11-09T22:11:29Z<br><p><span style="color: rgb(15, 20, 25);">Witness: FBI showed up at my job, asking me questions, when this statement was given it was to best recollection that I could, with everything going on, I was stressed out at the time. Sorry [not sorry].</span></p>
2021-11-09T22:12:13Z<br><p>Kraus: You didn't put in statement that Grosskreutz pointed gun? </p><p><br></p><p>Correct.  What can I tell you, I'm not a detective. </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-09T22:13:20Z<br><p>Kraus:  Did you turn your camera on to take video of shooting?</p><p><br></p><p>No. Hectic situation. </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: You're there to document things.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm not a professional. </p>
2021-11-09T22:14:43Z<br><p>Kraus: In statement, all you say is I saw Gaige shot and mist of blood. You left out important stuff?</p><p><br></p><p>Witness: I'm not a detective, I'm don't know what is important. </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: You saw him load gun? How do you know it was loaded?</p><p><br></p><p>WTF Kraus. </p>
2021-11-09T22:16:02Z<br><p>Kraus: You intended to include all important information, true and accurate account?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.  I don't understand what you are trying to ask me. </p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: True and accurate account of my statement to him?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-09T22:16:49Z<br><p>Kraus: You said Rosenbaum had a chain, swung it around a while, so you know it was gone?</p><p><br></p><p>At some point, yes. </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-09T22:17:23Z<br><p>Kraus: Did you see Kyle before the Car Source lot on that night?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Kraus: Always out alone?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. The couple times I saw him. </p>

2021-11-09T22:18:11Z<br><p>Witness claims he's very anxious now. </p><p><br></p><p>He's a rock. </p>
2021-11-09T22:18:34Z<br><p>Kraus: You said Huber and Grosskreutz yelling at Kyle to stop.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Kyle did not stop.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-09T22:19:22Z<br><p>Kraus: In my office you told me you were scared of an active shooter?</p><p><br></p><p>I don't remember saying that.</p><p><br></p><p>Were they trying to stop an active shooter?</p><p><br></p><p>They were trying to stop the person running?</p>
2021-11-09T22:20:09Z<br><p>Kraus: Said Rosenbaum said, just got out of jail, not afraid to go back, do you know if he got out of jail?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p>
2021-11-09T22:20:46Z<br><p>Kraus: When Rosenbaum made that comment, you didn't see Rittenhouse around.</p><p><br></p><p>No, many people around. </p>
