2021-11-02T14:14:48Z<br><p>Judge saying he sent out some instructions at about 1am or so. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Asked court to take up motion for reconsideration, filed a week ago Monday, objection to 2176, my reading of it, the notes set forth what is to happen or how is the court to do it when an alleged exception, which we are alleging here, and I think that exception has to be put into the jury instruction, but as now there is not an exception, so does need to be put into instruction if the court does not consider our motion.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: I have not completed my work on your motion, I didn't get it until later last week, looked at some it, not all of ti, some of it I need to check, so not prepared to give a final ruling. I think I should instruct on it, but what you're asking for is exceptional language, the instruction won't be frozen at time it is given this morning, to acquaint jurors with the particular case, I can tell jury I'm instructing on everything at the end of the case. </p>
2021-11-02T14:17:14Z<br><p>ADA Jim Kraus--defense is raising an affirmative defense, they can do that if they want, it's not a reason to dismiss. If they wish to present a case, affirmative defense, that he was compliant with both those subsections, he had a hunter safety permit or whatever, they can do so, but until they do that I don't see why that should be in jury instruction, we don't have self-defense in jury instruction because that's an affirmative defense. </p><p><br></p><p>He's speaking here of the first exposure of jury to jury instructions at the start of the trial, not necessarily the final jury instructions.</p><p><br></p><p>ADA Kraus--not sure how to treat the curfew violation, that's a 6 person, different standard of proof.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: You don't think I can have a 12 person jury do it?</p>
2021-11-02T14:20:22Z<br><p>Schroeder: I'll refrain on instruction on count 6 or 7 (gun charge and curfew charge)--but then they don't know what we're talking about.  </p><p><br></p><p>What's response to state claim that it''s an affirmative defense.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: NOT an affirmative defense, it's an exception for people 16+.  It IS an affirmative defense for people under 16, agree with that, but legislative history tells you that it does not apply PERIOD to 16 or 17-year-olds who possess firearms, I provided that to the court.  </p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: I'm going to give the instruction, it's educational not written, they don't get a copy, and can always modify before they get the final jury instruction at the end, before jury goes into deliberations. Don't want to leave them uninstructed, don't want to misinstruct them. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: State's interpretation makes it a strict liability offense, and statute clearly sets out exceptions for that. </p>
2021-11-02T14:22:53Z<br><p>This confusion is really on Judge Schroeder, he should have addressed this debate on the gun charge, the parties have been arguing on this for quite some time before the trial started.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Any other jury instruction issues?</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: For counts 1-4 see a reference to self-defense, specifically for counts?  But don't see that for count 5?</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: I didn't give a general self-defense?  You're right.  Count 5 is attempt to commit murder? Going to have the same self-defense instruction as count 1, 3, 4. You were correct in your observation.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T14:25:31Z<br><p>Schroeder: What else?</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Court has included with respect to count 2, McGinnis, reckless endangerment, jury instruction 820 is mentioned, I guess the language I'm having trouble with, first full paragraph, last sentence says the defendant doesn't have a privilege of self-defense with respect to McGinnins, but later says if defendant is acting in lawful self-defense, his conduct does not create a reckless risk to others.  Confusing.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Stumbled over same language, decided the intent that he does not have a privilege of self-defense as to third person, but the fact that he was in exercise privilege of self-defense is a factor for jury to consider if his conduct was criminally reckless, and also whether it was done with utter disregard for human life.   Certainly don't think I would want--you could put a law school test together on th at.  Where's my error.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: If he's in self-defense as it relates to Rosenbaum, according to 820, he then has a perfect self-defense, did not create an unreasonable risk to another. </p>
2021-11-02T14:27:56Z<br><p>Schroeder: Imagine I'm on street, conronted, family of four chidlren behind him, I'm in fear of death by this individual, I whip out a gun, open fire, and in the danger zone is not only the actor with whom I have perfect self-defense privilege, but also the four children behind him. I think, when jury decides about charges involving four children the jury is to consider whether I was acting in self-defense with respect of the bad actor, factor whether my conduct was reckless with respect to children, and whether showed utter disregard to human life. Jury migh decide you should have changed your position so children not in background. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: I read 820 to say if acting in perfect self-defense, instruction says you DID NOT then create an unreasonable risk to others?  I don't think if it's self-defense on the bad actor, by that fact according to 820, the instruction says YOUR CONDUCT DID NOT CREATE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO ANOTHER. Period. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T14:29:13Z<br><p>Schroeder: Why does it say up above that, in second sentence, the fact that the law may allow use of force in self-defense does not necessarily mean that recklessly endangering McGinnis was lawful?  </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi:  That's what I'm saying [??]</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: If the defendant was acting in lawful self-defense, his conduct did not create an unreasonable risk to another. Period. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T14:29:52Z<br><p>All this jury instruction stuff should have been wrapped up long before the morning of the first day of trial!</p><p><br></p><p>Good decisions are unlikely to be made in these circumstances, judge knows he's keeping the jury waiting, wants to get things rolling.</p>
2021-11-02T14:33:24Z<br><p>Schroeder: If you look at comments [to that instruction,] from instruction committee, near the end it says, for example defendant charged with reckless injury, and raises defense acting ins elf-defense by someone else, criminal reckless reuqires unreasonable and substantial risk of death, in considering reasonableness the jury should consider if defendant was acting in self-defense. </p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: You are arguing self-defense wipes out reckless, I don't think that's the law now. The jury, when approach the McGinnis case looks at whether the defendant, even if exercising perfect self-defense with respect to Rosenbaum, he doesn't have a self-defense as to McGinnis endangerment, but jury told to consider the self-defense Rosenbaum as to whether acts relative to McGinnis is unreasonable. </p>
2021-11-02T14:36:41Z<br><p>Schroeder: Now I'm going to skirt around instructions for 6 and 7, we don't have an instruction for 7 [!], and 6 is very knotty [that's the gun charge].</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Any other questions on instructions?  No.</p><p><br></p><p>ADA Binger wants something on the record re: jury.  Someone from our office came in to do the A/B stuff, passed by one of our jurors, #52, my understanding is that #52 recognized him, said hey how are you doing, and our staffer responded politely in response.  Staffer tells us he had previous employment he remembers #52 from that's the extent of their prior knowledge of each other. Told counsel about it this morning, just wanted to get that on the record. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Do you feel need to ask her if that impacts her ability to serve. </p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: OK. We're ready to go forward.</p>
2021-11-02T14:37:41Z<br><p>Schroeder: I do have a note here, not sure where it came from, there's a juror number on it by court clerk.  </p><p><br></p><p>Microphone muted to discuss juror note. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T14:40:53Z<br><p>Schroeder: OK, let''s ask lawyers to come up.</p><p><br></p><p>Lawyers approach the bench, presumably to discuss juror issue.</p><p><br></p><p>Microphones muted again.</p>
2021-11-02T14:43:23Z<br><p>Judge Schroeder is making a phone call from bench phone, asked male who answered to come down to courtroom. </p>
2021-11-02T14:44:08Z<br><p>Microphones muted, but everyone just stood up--probably means the jury is being shown into the courtroom.</p>
2021-11-02T14:45:22Z<br><p>Microphone live. Schroeder: "One to a chair, please!" Joking, jurors must be getting seated. They'll likely each own these specific seats for the duration of the trial.  Like choosing a side of the bed when one gets married--fixed forever. :-)</p>
2021-11-02T14:47:39Z<br><p>Seems there's one juror with special circumstances, some kind of scooter, complicates jury seating a little bit. </p>
2021-11-02T14:49:01Z<br><p>Judge Schroeder: Welcomes jurors. Apologizes for slight delay in getting started. </p><p><br></p><p>Clerk of court swears in jurors. </p>
2021-11-02T14:50:20Z<br><p>Judge: Want to give you some instructions, guide your duty as jurors. Duty to decide case solely as evidence develops at trial, and as law given to you in my instructions. Nothing outside courtroom is evidence. Don't allow any prejudice affect your view of evidence. Don't discuss case with each other until all evidence presented and instructed on law. Don't discuss with anyone else until after deliberations. </p>
2021-11-02T14:50:42Z<br><p>Judge: Sometimes things might need to be discussed outside your presence, may be excused from courtroom if that's necessary. </p>
2021-11-02T14:51:26Z<br><p>Judge: When in jury room need to stay there, can't be wandering around hallways, if have permission of bailiffs can go to break room across hall for vending machines, or outside for fresh air or to smoke, bailiffs will escort you so you need to go as a group.  Then back directly to jury room. </p>
2021-11-02T14:52:16Z<br><p>Judge: Do not research any informatin, do not investigate on own or visit scene. No news reports on trial. Do not consult reference material. Do not seek public records. Any information from outside courtroom could be misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete. Parties would not have opportunity to dispute or correct.</p>
2021-11-02T14:52:53Z<br><p>Judge: Do not use computer or cellphone or any electronic device to share information about the case, including social media.  If anybody communicates with you, report that to court.  Tempting to discuss with members of household, but must not do so. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T14:54:12Z<br><p>Judge: You are to decide case solel on evidence offered and received at this trial Sworn testimony of witnesses on direct and cross. Exhibits that are received. Facts which lawyers have stipulated, or which I direct you to find. </p>
2021-11-02T14:54:16Z<br><p>Judge: Lawyers have duty to object to improper questions or evidence they believe is inadmissible. Don't draw any conclusions from objection being made.  </p>
2021-11-02T14:55:00Z<br><p>Judge: You are sole judges of the evidence.  Welcome to take notes if you wish, don't let doing so distract you. May use your notes during deliberations to refresh your recollection. </p><p><br></p><p>Not all jursidictions allow this. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge: After trial notes will be collected and destroyed. </p>
2021-11-02T14:55:14Z<br><p>Judge: Must rely primarily on your memory of the evidence. </p>
2021-11-02T14:56:12Z<br><p>Judge: You are sole judges of credibility of witnesses, and weight to be given their testimony. You should consider these factors: Whether witness has interest in outcome, conduct, appearance, demeanor, clarity, opportunity witness had to know of what they are speaking, reasonableness, apparent intelligence, bias, prejudice if shown, possible motives to falsify, and all other facts and circumstances that support or discredit. </p>
2021-11-02T14:58:35ZJudge now working through criminal charge counts.<br><p>Judge: First count of information charges that defendant recklessly caused death of Joseph Rosenbaum. First-degree reckless homicide, reckless killing with utter disregard of human life.  State must prove following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt; Defendant caused the death of another. Criminally reckless conduct, risk of death or great bodily harm that was unreasonable and substantial and awareness creating that risk.  And circumstnaces show utter disregard for human life. Utter disregard--what he was doing, why engaged, how dangerous, how obvious danger, whether showed any regard for life, and all facts and circumstances relating to conduct. </p>
2021-11-02T15:00:47Z<br><p>Judge: second and third counts; reckless endangerment, McGinnis and unknown male. Reckless endangerment of first degree, recklessly endangers safety of another with utter disregard for human life. State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt three elements:  First, defendant endangered the safety of another. Second, did so by criminally reckless conduct--again, means conduct created risk of death or great bodily harm and risk was unreasonable and substantial and that the defendant was aware conduct created that risk.  (Defines great bodily harm.) Third, circumstances of conduct showed utter disregard for human life--in determining that, consider what doing, why doing it, danger of conduct, how obvious the danger, whether showed any regard for life, and all other circumstances relating to conduct. </p>
2021-11-02T15:02:53Z<br><p>Judge: Fourth count, intentionally caused death of Huber.  First degree homicide, caused death of another human with intent. State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt two elements: First, defendant caused death of another, and second that defendant acted with intent to kill another human. Intent to kill means had mental purpose to take life, or aware conduct was practically certain to kill.  The intent need not have existed for any particular length of time [no deliberation required]. Intent can form in an instant. Intent: from defendant's acts, statements, and all circumstances. Intent should not be confused with motive--no proof of motive is necessary to a conviction. </p>
2021-11-02T15:05:16Z<br><p>Judge: Fifth count, attempted to cause death of Grosskreutz.  Charge of attempted intentional homicide of first-degree. Formed the intent and would have committed that crime but for intervention of some other factors. State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt two elements: First intended to kill another human being. Second that defendant did acts towards the commission of the act, demonstrate unequivocally that he intended to kill and would have but for intervention of other factor. Unequivocably means no other reasonable explanation.</p>
2021-11-02T15:08:02Z<br><p>Judge: Sixth count, defendant person under age of 18 and armed with a dangerous weapon. </p><p><br></p><p>No accompanying instructional language here, the parties are still arguing over this charge. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge: Seventh count, the curfew offense. Civil ticket offense.  </p><p><br></p><p>Judge: I'll give you a more complete instruction on counts 6 and 7 at end of trial. 6th count, circumstances when lawful for person under 18 to have gun in possession, and 7th has to do with curfew rules. </p>
2021-11-02T15:08:58Z<br><p>Judge: First five counts allege not only that defendant committed the crimes charged, but also that he did so using a dangerous weapon. If you find guilty on any of those counts, must also determine if dangerous weapon used. Any firearm loaded or unloaded is a dangerous weapon. </p><p><br></p><p>This is the +5 years sentencing enhancement.</p>
2021-11-02T15:09:11Z<br><p>Judge: Reading self-defense instructional language. </p>
2021-11-02T15:13:28Z<br><p>Judge: State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did NOT act lawfully in self-defense, with respect to charges 1 (reckless homicide Rosenbaum), 3 (unknown male reckless), 4 (Huber intentional homicide), 5 (Grosskreutz attempted intentional homicide). </p><p><br></p><p>Judge is in ERROR here, he's NOT applying SD as defense to McGinnis recklessness charge, but IS applying SD to unknown male recklessness charge. Should do BOTH recklessness charges the same way. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge: No self-defense defense to recklessness charge against McGinnis (count 2), McGinnis was not threat to him. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge SD applicable to Rosenbaum, but doesn't follow through to McGinnis who was in area, and, so you have to analyze that separately--well, I'll get further into it. </p>
2021-11-02T15:14:37Z<br><p>Judge: Decisions can be reasonable, even if mistaken. Determined from standpoint of defendant at time of his acts, not from perspective of sitting in courtroom. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge: If defendant acting lawfully in respect to SD re: Rosenbaum, his conduct did not create an unreasonable risk to another.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge is mangling these jury instructions, at least in context of his own comments this morning. </p>
2021-11-02T15:16:17Z<br><p>Judge: Defendant presumed innocent, only guilty if proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Burden to establish every fact to find guilt is on the state.  If you can reconcile the evidence on any reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence, then you must do so, and acquite. Reasonable doubt based on reason and evidence. </p>
2021-11-02T15:16:39Z<br><p>Reasonable doubt not based on speculation or sympathy. </p>
2021-11-02T15:18:27Z<br><p>Judge: Going to hear opening statements now. State speaks first.  Not like you may have seen court proceedings on TV. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge: No such thing as "opening argument," argument is at end, this is "opening STATEMENT."  Give you an overview of their view case, alert you to things to look for, what they intend to show. And these are brief. ADA Binger will address first on behalf of state, then Mr. Richards for the defense.  No note taking now, discussion by the lawyers. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T15:18:36ZState Opening Statement by ADA Binger<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T15:20:32Z<br><p>Binger: Evidence will show on August 25, 2020, 17 years old, armed with AR-15 styule semi-auto rifle with 30 rounds in magazine, and he shot and killed Rosenbaum, an unarmed man. A shot to the back. Occurred after defendant chased down Mr. Rosenbaum and confronted him while wielding AR-15. Defendant fled the scene of dead body without stopping to offer any aid, as running, word spreads through crowd, an active shooter running through the ara, and the citizens there attempt to stop him. Approach him one hits him in back of head, one hits him with skateboard, Huber. Defendant trips and falls. Uknown male attempts to kick defendant in face. He is unarmed. Defendant points AR-15 at flying individual and fires twice, person not hit. </p>
2021-11-02T15:22:43Z<br><p>Binger: Immediately after, Huber holding a skateboard comes in and reaches for gun, grabs it and tries to pull it from defendant, defendant has it strapped to body, gun is slung from that, attached to him.  Huber's efforts are unsuccessful because of strap, and in struggle gun ends up pointed at Huber chest, defendant first one round, killing him instantly. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Grosskreutz has followed chase on foot, approaches defendant, holding cell phone in one hand, and a Glock semi-auto pistol in the other hand. Runs up to the defendant, defendant turns to Grosskreutz, who raises his hand, defendant then turns rifle over, begins to examine it. Grosskreutz blades body, reaches for defendant, right hand pulled back, and as he reaches defendant firest 8th round into Grosskreutz' right arm.  Runs off sceaming for medic. Defendant stands up and walks away. </p>
2021-11-02T15:25:31Z<br><p>Binger: Defendant killed two, shot at a third, and wounded Grosskreutz in arm, who was armed with a gun. Our position that this evidence demonstrates the criminal charges. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: That's the snapshot. Also wider context. Occurs during context of events following shooting of Jacob Blake, occurred Sunday August 23, 2020, community erupted in protest, looting, rioting, arson and violence, Sunday and Monday two of the roughest nights our community has ever seen. Well aware of damage community suffered. Car Source, and other properties that were damaged. Fortunately, in entire sequence of events, all property damage. And one we all agreed on is that life is more important than property. Up until Tuesday night, no one had been killed.  What happened as time went on, people of Kenosha who felt outrage began to protest, but like moths to a flame, tourists from outside were drawn to the chaos.  People from outside Kenosha came in and contributed to that chaos, and it caused many of our citizens to fear for their safety, homes, families, and take steps to protect themselves, arm themselves, board up windows, move, take time away from community. All understandable and reasonable. </p>
2021-11-02T15:27:06Z<br><p>Binger: Of hundreds of people on streets, only person who killed anyone, was the defendant, Kyle Rittenhouse. Hundreds of people on streets experiencing chaos and violence, only Rittenhouse killed. Show you videos, police, teargas, rubber bullets, only person who killed was defendnat. Fireworks going off, guns being discharged, sound of gunfire, hundreds of people are there experiencing this, but the only one who kills anyone is the defendant.  </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: We sill show you video of hostile confrontation of hundreds of people, getting in each other's faces, and yet only person who killed anyone is the defendant. Hundreds of people experienced that chaos, only one who killed anyone is the defendant, Kyle Rittenhouse. </p>
2021-11-02T15:29:28Z<br><p>Binger: Recently heard someone joke that jury service is bringing in people and paying them $8/hour to solve a mruder. We're not asking you to solve the killing, there is no doubt that the defendant had the gun that night, shot 8 bullets, four hit Rosenbaum, two at unknown male, one into Huber, one into Grosskruetz.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Central issue will be self-defense. Factors to keep in mind--defendant used deadly force. That privilege to use deadly force is limited, defendant must have reasonably believed the force was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.  </p><p><br></p><p>Reading now from self-defense jury instruciton. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You, jury, will apply that standard of reasonableness and determine if his use of deadly force was reasonable, necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm. </p>
2021-11-02T15:30:48Z<br><p>Binger: Context of that evening, in some chronological order.  First witness, Domnick Black, at time of incident, dating Mackensy Rittenhouse, defendant sister. He got to know defendant. Black bought the AR-15 for the defendant, using money from the defendant to buy the gun. Why necessary for Black to do that? Because defendant was 17, because of that he cannot purchase a gun, can't legally own a gun. </p>
2021-11-02T15:34:05Z<br><p>Binger: Then spent time at Black hunting property, fired the AR-15, practicing using them. Then they agreed that gun would not go home with defendant to IL, would stay with Black. In Kenosha, until August 25, 2020. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: On Monday night prior, defendant stayed at Black residence, decided that next day would do something about what was going on in Kenosha.  Work on cleaning up some graffiti. Decide to come back later that night and protect a local business, Car Source, 59th and Sherida. Has three locations. One on east side Sheridan, 58th.  That entire property was destroyed Monday night.  Across street, another Car Source. Some cars also damaged Monday night. On Tuesday defendant encounters owner of CAr Source has discussion about protecing 59th street location.  Go out and acquire straps to sling the rifles when they come back that night. Return, meet up with other folks interested in protecting Car Soruce, start at 63rd street, third location, then agree to go to 59th street.  Protect it. Nothing wrong with that, lawful. </p>
2021-11-02T15:36:54Z<br><p>Binger: Some of people defending, some on ground. Black was on roof, stay removed from people on ground.  Will hear and see videos of sequence of events, evening begins with large scale protests, rioting, right outside these windows, right outside this courthouse.  Crowd of police lined up to protect this building, public safety building next door, large group of people screaming at police, throwing projectiles, tear gas very voatile, Three blocks north of CAr Sourece where defendant was. Then police push line bast Car Source, establish line at 60th and Sheridan, one block south. Many protestors pass by defendant and others at 59th street. Words exchagned, hostility, but no one hurt, no one fires a gun, no one injured. But antagonism, this is crowd not  on same side as defendant, did not see him as an ally, hostile exchange. At one point members of crowd pull dumpster into street and attempt to set it on fire, and others with defendant put fire out, and have very harsh interaction with people in street. It is this process that demonstrated for defendant that this is not a safe crowd to be in, does not view him as ally, if he ventures out into it there could be problems. </p>
2021-11-02T15:40:33Z<br><p>Binger: Once police pass by, and protestors past 60th, evidence will show Car Source where defendant at is no longer in danger, no one there attempting to damage property, going to do anything to harm anybody. The situation has moved on.  Does the defendant stay there? Decide to go home? No, Defendant and another individual Ryan Balch decide to venture out into the crowd. Cross the police line at 60th and Sheridan and walk amongst group of hostile protestors, window up at gas station, Ultimate Gas, you'll see video, groups of people clashing verbally, some shoving going on, and in the midst of this is Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum had been discharged from hospital that very day, came downtown and got caught up in midst of protests. You will see him carrying a plastic bag, some is clear and seethrough, it has a white drawstring, the type of bag the evidence will show that you get at hospital.  He's carrying it around most of that evening, and at various points Rosenbaum is agitated, getting in faces, using obscenities, daring peole to respond. At ultimate gas gets in face of armed people, armed like defendant, confronting them in their faces. None of those folks shoot him. He's 5' 3", 150 pounds. No one appears to take him as a serioius danger. Defendant at Ultimate, so is Balch, Balch will testify tehre was an udnerstanding that when we cross south of 60th we stay together, but if separated head back to 59th street. Balch does, defenadnt attempts to, police won't let him pass. </p>
2021-11-02T15:42:40Z<br><p>Binger: Defendant could have gone a block in either direction if he wasnted to go back, returns to Ultimate gas station. See him on video of Corey Eligah, catches defendant passing in front of him with fire extinguisher, rifle still slung. This caught his attenion, where's he going twith fire extinguisher. We will show you that video, as he follows defendant.  He passes by the defendant who is walking with fire extinguisher all by himself.  Then Elijah passes by Rosenbaum, shirt around his head, plastic shopping back towards 63rd street CAr Source. Defendant behind Rosenbaum. As they get to that block has a house at 62nd and Sheridan, and at south side is Car Source. </p>
2021-11-02T15:45:59Z<br><p>Binger: You will hear testimony from FBI, in plane that night taking video, infrared video, picks up heat.  Picks up Rosenbaum, a white blob on image.  See him running towards 63rd Car Source, and behind him, running in same direction, following him, is the defendant. As get to lot, Rosenbaum peels off behind those cares, and defendant stops and turns to Rosenbaum. With inifrared, don't know exactly what was going on, what words were said, whatever that confrontation initiated by defendant started, caused Rosenbaym to come around car and start coming after defendant. Defendant drops fire extinguisher and runs. At some point in defendant turns, Rosenbaum has hands in air, almost what are you going to do, defenant stops, Rosenbaum contineus to run. Then a gunshot by Joshua ziminski, 30 feet away, decided to fire handgun once in air.  In a different direction, many feet from defendant. Rosenbaum continues to puruse defendant, Detective will time Ziinsky shot is 2.5 seconds, defendant turns and fires four shots at Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum suffered five wounds from four bullets. The first two wounds inflicted were to his lower extremeties.  Pelvis and lower left thigh. Caused Rosenbaum to fall face forward. </p>
2021-11-02T15:47:23Z<br><p>Binger: As he's falling, defendant fires two more shots, one hits Rosenbaum in back, that's the shot that kills him according to doctor Kelly.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Richie McGinnis, reporter cam to cover events that night. Interviews defendant, talks to him, follows him, right behind defendant when shootings occur. He is in Car Source lot, behind Rosenbaum when shot. And one of those rounds came close to him, basis for count that McGinnis was recklessly placed in danger by defendant. When McGinnis saw Rosenbaum shot and fall he ran up and tried to treat Rosenbaum.  </p>
2021-11-02T15:50:36Z<br><p>Binger: Many other people respond and attempt to help Rosenbaum. That's what McGinnis does. The defendant, after shooting Rosenbaum, gets on phone calls Black, says I just shot someone, and ran away.  </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You'll see defendant held himself out as a medic, but offers no aid to Rosenbaum, he runs, encounters another member of group from 59th street, Jason McCoskey, similarly armed, former Marine, he will testify he met Rittenhouse as he fled the scene, Rittenhouse says I didn't shoot anybody but need help, he tells Rittenhouse to go to police, and Rittenhouse. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Crowd knows Rittenhouse shot somebody, they believe he's an active shooter, they begin to follow, and I've described what follows.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: So when we talk in trial about August 25, keep in mind context of that night, hundreds of people experiencing same chaos loud noises same gunfire, tear gas hostile interactions, but out of hundreds of people only one person killed anyone that night, shot anyone that night. When we consider the reasonableness of defendant's actions, keep that in mind. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T15:51:16Z<br><p>Binger: Will hear first from Black, Elijah, Detective, use that television to show you videos.  You will get the full story here in the courtroom, will see things that have not been made public yet. </p>
2021-11-02T15:53:08Z<br><p>Binger: You will hear from FBI individual in plane taking infrared and shows defendant chasing Rosenbaum and initiating the confrontation. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You will hear more about Rosenbaum from his girlfriend. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Will hear Huber was a skateboarder, lived for that, knew Jacob Blake personally, wanted to show support for Blake, his friend. Will hear what sort of person he was.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Will here from law enforcement who did the investigative work to develop evidnece against defendant. Will hear from the doctor, and will hear that shot that killed Rosenbaum was a shot to the back. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: And I think you will agree defendant is guilty of all these charges. </p><p><br></p><p>That's it for Binger's opening. </p>

And final is photo from police surveillance at 1:20am of Kyle and mother turning himself in to police.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: I thought the opening was to be a summary of the evidence, not the evidence itself. This is highly unreasonable.  Both sides will have opportunity to call witness, to characterize during closing, but to give the jury what the defense considers evidence, for opening to be the entire defense case, and all the evidence, highly unusual. I took the approach in my opening statement, guess I was not pushing envelope as hard as I could have, but I'm not the witness, I'm not giving them the evidence. That's what the witnesses are for. We've stipulated authenticitiy, doesn't mean we've conceded relevance. You stressed, took five minutes fo rhim to list all of them, let alone what it will take to show them. As a general policy, I understand it's not the law, but witnesses should be presenting evidence, not attorneys in opening. I object to this precedure, it's overly long, witnesses should do this, counsel should be describing what evidence will show, but showing them all the evidence, why even have witnesses? </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T16:33:26Z<br><p>Schroeder: Can you authenticate every one of these. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: All come from exhibit stipulated to authenticity. </p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Sounded like I already heard about. </p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: To Binger--standard is not what you did, but what is allowed. And rule says this is allowed. Not common, but I've seen it done--BY YOUR OFFICE.  Many examples, but many charges, many allegations by the state. Do appear to all be relevant and agreed to be authentic, I don't see any reason I should interefere.</p><p><br></p><p>Schreoder: Binger makes good point that should be brief.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: I don't expect to be any longer than him. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T16:36:43Z<br><p>Binger: Understand that Richards plans to talk about issues that I had asked he not be allowed to talk about, he thinks I opened the door, conduct between Rosenbaum and his girlfriend, restraining order between them.</p><p><br></p><p>Rosenbaum: He can't have it both ways, he can't say he was at the girlfriend's house and couldn't stay there. Why can't we say why?  Restraining order.  He says Rosenbaum got out of the hospital. It was a mental hospital, and we can't say that? It's insane.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T16:38:49Z<br><p>Schroeder: I thought when I read pre-trial motions, series on agreement, may have not have best recall on those, but I thought the references, statements attributed to Rosenbaum I just got out of jail today. You're telling me there was also a discussion of hospital?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Is there testimonial, testimony that he made statements that he got out of jail that day?</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: In opening, to Binger, you said, I thought I'm surprised you're going into this, because it might trigger a response. </p>
2021-11-02T16:40:11Z<br><p>Binger: I said he got out of hospital, carrying plastic bag from hospital.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: I understand.  You also made statement about his being with girlfriend. Non-contact order. Do we know the exact scope of that order. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: I believe it was typical--</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: No, no, no nothing is typical. What did you say about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: I said he couldn't stay with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Why did you say that?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Explains why he was downtown. </p>
2021-11-02T16:43:31Z<br><p>Richards: Binger is misleading by simply saying "hospital."  He was not acting appropriately, that's part of the defense. He says, "can't stay there," why not, there was a court order. He wasn't supposed to go there in the first place.  Bond is no contact including residence. </p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: I don't think, as far as opening, you need to respond to hospital. I'll have to separately decide if he opened the door, or even if admissible, suspect it is not.  As far as not being there, or not supposed to be there, not sure I want to hear about that in your opening, but will hear later as to why relevant. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: He's talking about my client traveling here to be out of bounds, but there's a reason Rosenbaum was there, too. </p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Let's not talk about those two things in opening. </p>
2021-11-02T16:43:43Z<br><p>All of that was with jury out of the courtroom, of course.</p><p><br></p><p>Jury being brought back in now. </p>
2021-11-02T16:44:40Z<br><p>Jury being shown back into courtroom. Opening by Defense counsel Richards is nexxt. </p>
2021-11-02T16:48:44ZDefense opening statement, Attorney Marc Richards<br><p>Richards: My chance to show  you what I believe the evidence will shot. Two very different outlooks on the events of August 25, 2020. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Kyle was present in Kenosha on Aug. 24, stayed at friend's residence, Black, saw the events of the 24th on TV. Saw Car Source #1, on east side of Sheridan, burned, all the automobiles burned, destroyed. He saw the looting. Other businesses burned down. Next morning he went downtown, looked at damage, helped clean up graffiti. He saw that, met one of the owners of Car Source, they talked, they decided that they would offer, him and Black and Nick Smith, to help protect the property of Car Source. The evidence will show, despite media, that Kyle had strong ties to Kenosha. His father lived in Kenosha, mother lived in Antioch IL. Kyle worked in Kenosha as a lifeguard. He went downtown to clean up,. and they decided to come back and help CAr Source #2, 59thSheridan dnCar source #3,60th and Sheridan. </p>
2021-11-02T16:50:25Z<br><p>Richards; Met others there, who had come to town at urging of web sites, and general distaste for destruction, from West Bend area, agreed that they would all help protect the Car Source lots. Initially to 59th early in evening. What will end up, you will see the events unfold in video, and still photos. Ultimately what this case will come down to, not a whodunit, it's was Kyle's actions privileged under the law of self-defense. That is, that the defendant believed there was an actual imminent unlawful interference iwth his person, amount of force used was necessary to prevent or terminate interference, and that his belief was reasonable. (Reading from slide here.) From standpoint of 17 year old as they existed that night. </p>
2021-11-02T16:51:54Z<br><p>Richards: Binger makes big deal that Kyle the only person to kill that night. True. Kyle only person chased by Rosenbaum. Here's his photo--to allow you to identify him over course of trial. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Rosenbaum at a location, had along with others, started a dumpster on fire, and when it was, close to a gas station, out, Rosenbaum became enraged.</p><p><br></p><p>Plays video of enraged Rosenbaum. "Shoot me, n-word! Shoot me, n-word!"</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T16:53:54Z<br><p>Richards: He was upset, yelling he wants to be shot, you will see other people holding him back trying to stop him getting to individual with baseball hat, rifle, short pants, looks very much like Kyle.</p><p><br></p><p>Rosenbaum with Joshua Ziminskik had just come from starting a trailer on fire. He arms himself with a chain and goes up and down Sheridan Road, carrying a heavy chain used to tie down equipment. </p><p><br></p><p>Next, still photo from Ultimate gas, shoot me n-word, shoot me n-word, at a black rights rally.</p><p><br></p><p>Behind him in that photo is Joshua Ziminski, they are together throughout the evening. And Joshua plays a central role, one creating chaos and havoc with Rosenbaum, and two more importantly at CAr Source #3 he is the one who fires the first shot that evening, behind Kyle as he's being chased by Rosenbaum.</p>
2021-11-02T16:55:05Z<br><p>Picture with two circles, Rosenbaum and Ziminski starting trailer on fire, along with dumpster. </p><p><br></p><p>Rosenbaum wearing a blue mask, not his shirt over his head, and carrying a bag I'm sure there will be much testimony about.</p><p><br></p><p>Another photo, from Ultimate, Ziminski armed with the weapon he ultimately firest at CAr source #3.</p><p><br></p><p>Red hair, Kelly Ziminski, big heavy flashlight. No need for light, other than as a weapon.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T16:57:14Z<br><p>Count 2, involves Richard McGinnis, reporter covering the riots, he will tell you that he was dressed like this that night, for identification purposes.</p><p><br></p><p>Had interviewed Kyle, and Balch and Kyle going out to see if anyone needed medical help, McGinnis to follow along. Goes out with them, and eventually they have interaction with "yellow pants man."  </p><p><br></p><p>This is Grosskreutz, comlaining witness in count5. Backpack, cell phone in hand, throughout evening.</p><p><br></p><p>Next photo, evidence shows Grosskreutz running down Sheridan and see his hand going into the back of waistband pulling out a firearm. Evidence eill show from witness DeBruin is yellow dot is Kyle as they chase him down Sheridan road. Grosskreutz not in danger, Kyle already told himself turning into police, yet Grosskreutz arms and attacks.</p>
2021-11-02T16:58:58Z<br><p>Photo of Huber attacking my client with skateboard as lying on ground, had already hit him as Kyle ran down the road, now hitting him in the head, and grabs Kyle's firearm.</p><p><br></p><p>Next photo, whole skateborad, the size of it, would love to hold it up for you as evidence, then you could see the weight and heft of what a skateboard, and what it would do if they swung it on someone shoulder, head, neck, trying to separate the head from the body, as Huber did. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Objection, strained interpretation.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Overruled.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: You'll get to make the call on what Huber was trying to do.  We can't get the skateboard here because Huber girlfriend refused to produce it. </p>
2021-11-02T17:00:12Z<br><p>Next photo, Ziminski holding back Rosenbaum.</p><p><br></p><p>Next, jump kick man, non-complaining witness, Kyle on ground, after being hit in head by rock, Huber hitting him with skateboard, kicks Kyle square in face with black boots.</p><p><br></p><p>Close up of boots.</p><p><br></p><p>As he's kicking him in the face, Kyle fires two shots at thim. Not hit. Runs off into night never to be seen again, never claims to be a witness. </p><p><br></p><p>Those are the big players in the case. </p>
2021-11-02T17:02:05Z<br><p>You'll have to decide looking at all the circumstances that evening.</p><p><br></p><p>Police push people to 60th, no line set up to stop Kyle going down southerly direction. No statement that if you go there, you can't come back. Kyle and Balch and McGinnis go down Sheridan road, and at 11:40pm they have a conversation yelling medic. Kyle has medical bag, gun, and comes across three individuals, and yellow pants accuses Kyle of pointing laser sight at gun. Kyle shrugs it off, does not want confrontation, he leaves. Why? Because he doesn't want trouble. These are the three people with yellow pants. One carries a noose.  Another had rocks in his hands. Blue shirt was carrying a 9mm firearm. </p>
2021-11-02T17:03:18Z<br><p>McGinnis will tell you about the marauding nature of these people, he was extremely upset. </p><p><br></p><p>Kyle realizes he's separated from Balch, goes to Ultimate looking for him, can't find him. Then tries to get back to Car Source at 59th and Sheridan.  </p><p><br></p><p>Video shown.  Police not allowing Kyle to return, ordering him through megaphone to not proceed. </p><p><br></p><p>Kyle: "Does anybody need medical?"  </p>
2021-11-02T17:07:13Z<br><p>Richards: They don't let him pass, goes back to Ultimate, a few minutes later phone call from Black, informs him that they are breaking windows and starting fires at Car Source #3. Kyle asks for fire extinguisher, is given one, Kyle heads down to Car Source #3. He doesn't know that Rosenbaum is down there, asked to go there by Nick Smith. Heads down Sheridan to Car Source #3. </p><p><br></p><p>Photo from video, leaving Car Source, has firearm, has fire extinguisher to put out the fires that are being started down there.</p><p><br></p><p>Aerial photo state referred to, started to roll, circles, Ziminsky in the green lettering, thermal image, people are labelled, Richie McGinnis, head down.  You see Rosenbaum come around from hiding in the cars, beginning to chase my client, see Ziminsky firearm, see flashes of first shots. I'm not responsible for cutting this video, I don't know how it got chopped up, that's the FBI up in the plane who took this video.  You'll see this 100 times, the individuals are heading down Sheridan, and youll see McGinnis, now over hear, go and hide in this location. You'll see Kyle come into this area, and pause, where Ziminsky's are, and you'll see in this car a fire is started.  And they go trying to get away from Rosenbaum. Kyle is under no obligation to retreat, whatsoever--but he does, runs away from Rosenbaum because he doesn't want trouble.  WHich m akes no sense if what state says is true about Kyle hunting him down. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T17:07:35Z<br><p>Richards: You'll hear testimony, <strong><em>not just from Kyle Rittenhouse--</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>WHAT?!?!?</p>
2021-11-02T17:09:52Z<br><p>Richards: --also from Balch that Rosenbaum had threatned to kill Kyle.</p><p><br></p><p>Rosenbaum could have stopped any time, continues to pursue. He's wearing marron shirt on his face as a mask, covering up his identify, because hw wants to steal my client's firearm, to use against him. That's not just the word of my client, you'll hear McGinnis, close that evening, following, he'll testify that he did not feel endangered, he was doing his job. He will testify that Rosenbaum let out, as he put it, one of the scariest screams I hever heard, F-you, and dove for Kyle's gun.</p><p><br></p><p>Kyle fires. He fires four shots, at Rosenbaum. The state wishes to slow everything down. Those four shots, the evidence will show took 0.76 seconds.  From first to last shot.  Those shots measurements will be put forth by Dr. John Black.  </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-02T17:12:09Z<br><p>Photo 1148, Car Source #3, see individual, right here, hand in the air. That's Mr. Ziminsky, this is Rosenbaum in full stride running after Rittenhouse. From a video. 11:48pm.  You'll hear Kyle's voice, friendly, friendly, friendly. He thinks because giving medical attention that people don't have animosity against him. He's wrong. But that's belief in his head. And Rosenbaum chasing after him.</p><p><br></p><p>State will want to say, why did he go down there? Nick Smith asked him to. Why didn't he keep running? First, don't have to run. But here's another video, in that direction were some 100 people smashing up cars with pipes and bats. </p>
2021-11-02T17:15:07Z<br><p>Richards: you'll see entire video during the trial. Individuals at car source destroying all those vehicles, Kyle did not want to run into those rioters as fleeing Rosenbaum. </p><p><br></p><p>First shot, Ziminksy, then four shots, Kyle firing Rosenbaum as he's trying to take Kyle's weapon to use against them. THen three more shots in quick succession, from another person in the car source lot firing for some reason. Never identified, never arrested.</p><p><br></p><p>Kyle running back to scene of shooting, will show, I think the evidence shows, why Kyle didn't stay and render aid, not that he's under any obligation to do that, but sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.  Get him!  The n-word just shot that dude. Cranium that boy! </p><p><br></p><p>The individuals who are yelling, he just shot him, shoot him, one of them with a gun, Mr. and Mrs. Ziminsky. He's not threatening anyone with his gun as he's running, he's running northerly from 63rd towards 60th. What is at 60th? That's where law enforcement is, where someone will run to be protected from a mob that wants to kill him.</p>
2021-11-02T17:18:15Z<br><p>Grosskreutz runs up, no gun in hand, Kyle does not threaten him does nothing to dissuade him from approaching, chats with Kyle.  Video from Gaige phone.  Kyle running, gun pointed down, Kyle did not point gun at him, did not shoot him, mob is clising in.</p><p><br></p><p>INdividual runs up behind Kyle hits him in head with  hand or hand with rock, Kyle knocked askew, hat being knocked off, hat stayed on his head all this time. Government doesn't want anybody to think he's being hit.  That's the first blow to Kyle.</p><p><br></p><p>Continues to run, testimony will show these people running up on him, important part here is on the left testimony will be that Huber is picking up his skateboard. ON the ground because he swung it at Kyle's head the FIRST time, hitting him in the head, see Kyle beginning to fall down. Two red marks are individual who struck first and jump kick man closing in. </p><p><br></p><p>Kyle on the ground, within two feet, person rushes up, Kyle points gun but does NOT fire.</p><p><br></p><p>Next photo, jump kick man kicking Kyle in the face. Behind him is Huber approaching with the skateboard. </p>
2021-11-02T17:20:01Z<br><p>Photo close up of jump kick man heavy work boots. </p><p><br></p><p>Another photo, Huber hand on skateboard, holding wields, striking Kyle head, jump kick man just landing, Huber's bare hand grabbing gun.  State will claim no DNA on the gun, must not have touched it, there's video photographic evidence of him touching the gun.</p><p><br></p><p>The bare hand on the gun, close up, Kyle on his back, most vulnerable position. Strap tight, Huber trying to pull gun away, Kyle afraid he'll be shot with his own weapon, fires one shot at Huber.</p><p><br></p><p>In this photo just entering on right is Grosskreutz. In one hand a phone, the other hand a firearm. </p>
2021-11-02T17:21:37Z<br><p>Grosskreutz here with hands up, Kyle does not fire. Huber skateboard hasn't even hit the ground yet, that's how fast all this is happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Grosskruetz does not stay or back up, closes on Kyle, pointing gun almost directly at Kyle's head. Gun is in the circle, approaching Kyle's head. Kyle fires once, hitting him. </p><p><br></p><p>Another photo, indivual approaches, after Grosskreutz shot, puts his hands up, Kyle does nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>In that events, event #2, the whole event from first shot with jump kick man, two misses, to the time Grosskreutz is shot, is about 5 seconds. You'll have exact times of those shots, how fast it occurs. </p>
2021-11-02T17:22:43Z<br><p>After the shooting that evening, Grosskreutz told law enforcement his story, one detail he forgot to mention is that he was armed when he got shot. Told police he lost his gun as running down Sheridan, didn't know he was caught on photo and video, he had gun in his hand, that's why he was shot. </p><p><br></p><p>His statement says he went into fray was because he had to stop Huber from beating Kyle with skateboard.</p><p><br></p><p>!!!!!</p>
2021-11-02T17:27:07Z<br><p>Kyle then continues north down Sheridan to 60th.  Walking towards police line with hands up.  </p><p><br></p><p>Police told Kyle to go home.  Makes his way to Car Source #2 back at 59th, meets up with Black tells them what happened, Black will testify that he saw him, he was white as a ghost, sweating like a pig, saying he had to do it, it was self-defense.  Go to Black's home. At 1:20am Kyle and mother walking into Antioch police department, to turn himself in, what he wanted to do here in Kenosha, but department here surrounded by fence, he couldn't.</p><p><br></p><p>Kyle' never denied his conduct, acted in self-defense, actions were reasonable under the circumstances as they existed that night being attacked by Rosenbaum. He didnt' endanger those other individuals, they can refer to him all they wish as an active shooter, the only people he shot were Rosenbaum, threatened to kill, ripping people's hearts out, not afraid to go back to jail, witness will testify that if there was trouble that night Rosenbaum was there.  That's who visited himself upon Kyle Rittenhouse. He thought he could get gun from Kyle. Kyle protected himself, protected rifle so he could protect himself and others from wrongful use of gun.  And then he protected himself from others chasing him. </p><p><br></p><p>That's what the evidence will show. </p><p><br></p><p>That's it for the defense opening. </p>

2021-11-02T18:27:40ZState calls Dominick Black to the witness stand<br><p>Worth keeping in mind that Black is facing his own criminal charges by prosecutors for the gun purchase for Kyle, so he's obviously under some degree of coercion--testify as the state likes here, maybe his own case is favorably resolved. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

WTF? </p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: What happened to our easel? </p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Right now defendant can't see it, I'm required to ensure he does, and I can't see it either. </p>
2021-11-02T18:53:21Z<br><p>Aerial image propped up. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Use laser pointer to show us where you were as events progressed. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You mentioned Car Source that had been previously affected, not sure what words you used.</p><p><br></p><p>He'd used "completely burned down."  </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Fair to say every car burned to chassis?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>

2021-11-02T18:57:40Z<br><p>This is all rather tiresome, none of this touches on any issue in dispute in the trial.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

Same one just tlaking about.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You and defendant both had guns, straps, ammo. </p><p><br></p><p>Jeepers, Binger, it's not a "strap," it's a "sling."  Oofah. </p>
