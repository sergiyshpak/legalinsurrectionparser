2021-11-03T14:24:38Z<br><p>Left off yesterday watching Washington's Facebook live stream from the scene on August 25, 2020.</p><p><br></p><p>Continuing that video now. </p>
2021-11-03T14:25:10Z<br><p>Police on megaphones shouting orders. </p><p><br></p><p>Crowd shouting back "F-YOU!"</p>
2021-11-03T14:26:52Z<br><p>Binger pauses video, someone walked through video carrying skateboard.  </p><p><br></p><p>That's Anthony Huber, hoodie with hood up, large skateboard. </p><p><br></p><p>Washington doesn't know it's Huber, but parties stipulate.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T14:26:54Z<br><p>Binger: On that night, did YOU have a skateboard?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Routinely? </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p>
2021-11-03T14:27:49Z<br><p>Individual who comes in from the left, shorts, T-shirt, hat, backpack, orange.  </p><p><br></p><p>Washington doesn't recognize.</p><p><br></p><p>It's Gaige Grosskreutz.</p>
2021-11-03T14:28:51Z<br><p>Video is being taken from the site of the Ultimate Gas Station.</p><p><br></p><p>Sudden loud noise.</p><p><br></p><p>Washington: Rock or something? Somebody threw something? </p>
2021-11-03T14:29:27Z<br><p>Binger: People with blue umbrella, pushing to toward police, any reaction from police to that?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T14:29:47Z<br><p>Incidentally, the gas price at Ultimate is $2.09.  The good old days! </p>
2021-11-03T14:36:23Z<br><p>Now in middle of screen of Washington video, Gaige Grosskreutz again.</p>
2021-11-03T14:37:44Z<br><p>Washington mentions in his video, something about a fire being put out. </p><p><br></p><p>Explains in court earlier in evening, randomly a fire down the block westward, staked down there, people came with fire extinguishers, worried people sneaking off to burn buildings. </p><p><br></p><p>Moments after we arrived, police arrived, a tire fire set by owner of shop, maybe? Not too sure, that's what I heard. </p>
2021-11-03T14:39:51Z<br><p>Is Binger trying to suggest that Kyle didn't need to respond to fire with extinguisher, running up to Car Source lot (where he would be attacked by, and would shoot, Rosenbaum), because the police response that night was so awesomely reliable?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T14:40:44Z<br><p>Binger: You mentioned in video, looked at your chat, said something about other stuff going on elsewhere in Kenosha.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Mentioned Pizza Hut on Roosevelt on fire?</p><p><br></p><p>Believe that was just a false rumor.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: A lot of rumors going around, some true some not, that night?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, lots of disinformation. </p>
2021-11-03T14:41:47Z<br><p>Binger: Individual in middle of photo with rifle, know who that is?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Ryan Balch.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T14:43:13Z<br><p>Binger: See someone come across screen, that's the defendant.  </p><p><br></p><p>Rittenhouse running from right to left of screen, with fire extinguisher in hand.</p>
2021-11-03T14:45:09Z<br><p>Binger: Heard you say, I don't know where he's going to, let's check it out. Referring to defendant?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Did you have any idea who he was?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Take any note of him that night?</p><p><br></p><p>Briefly, mental note, just looked over people generally around me, especially people who are armed, to gauge the crowd and environment. He looked young, smoking cigarettes and such, seemed an interesting figure, nothing malicious, just young person in a situation. Mainly the gloves [blue medic gloves], just remembered that, didn't know why he had those on. Thought maybe someone chasing him [!!!] or what the situation might be?</p>
2021-11-03T14:45:40Z<br><p>Binger: Why note him right then?</p><p><br></p><p>Not much happening, just standing around, to see someone running, could have been anybody running by I would have been intrigued. </p><p><br></p><p>And he had fire extinguisher, maybe going to extinguish a fire. </p>
2021-11-03T14:46:30Z<br><p>Binger: Next you'll be going in same direction as defendant?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Anyone with him?</p><p><br></p><p>Not that I recall. </p>
2021-11-03T14:50:00Z<br><p>State points out Richie McGinnis on the screen. </p>
2021-11-03T14:51:05Z<br><p>Seeing defendant on screen now, in Washington's video. </p><p><br></p><p>Kyle running down street with fire extinguisher, towards Car Source lot where he would be attacked by Rosenbaum.</p>
2021-11-03T14:51:35Z<br><p>Binger: Person in center of screen, no shirt, carrying bag, Joseph Rosenbaum.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T14:51:51Z<br><p>I guess this is where Binger claims that Rittenhouse was "chasing" Rosenbaum?</p>
2021-11-03T14:53:01Z<br><p>Binger: Seeing bright lights in screen, what is that location?</p><p><br></p><p>Car Source lot, Sheridan and 63rd? </p><p><br></p><p>Site where Kyle attacked by Rosenbaum.</p>
2021-11-03T14:55:45Z<br><p>Binger pointing out Rosenbaum again on video, as Washington is skateboarding down Sheridan, slowly, towards the Car Source lot, which is brightly illuminated.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: This is Rosenbaum in video, right here.  </p><p><br></p><p>Video continues. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: So jury knows where to watch, ask jurors to pay attention to area in front of Car Source, see figures running from right to left.</p><p><br></p><p>This will be Rosenbaum chasing down Rittenhouse. </p>
2021-11-03T14:56:22Z<br><p>Binger: Just heard the shooting of Rosenbaum. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: There was a first shot, which was not Rittenhouse's shot. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: We'll cover that.</p>
2021-11-03T14:56:45Z<br><p>Binger: What did you do at shots?</p><p><br></p><p>Skated away, for safety? Position behind retaining wall, tried to film from there.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T14:57:58Z<br><p>Binger: That's Joshua Ziminsky.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Four shots we just heard were the four shots defendant fired at Rosenbaum.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Several other shots heard then, those were not fired by Kyle Rittenhouse. </p>
2021-11-03T14:59:24Z<br><p>Binger: One final question. When you arrived at 63rd Street Car Source, you recorded video with phone, and using own eyes to look at what's going on.  Did you see any fires at the 63rd Street Car Source?</p><p><br></p><p>Fires? No. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: For record, to button this all up, I believe that was Exhibit #11, video of Koerri Elijah, move that into evidence. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T14:59:47ZChirafisi on cross-examination of Koerri Washington<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T15:00:16Z<br><p>Chirafisi: On night on 25th, did you receive a curfew ticket?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Aware there was a curfew?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>You agree you were out past curfew?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T15:01:00Z<br><p>Chirafis: Social media influencer?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Do you travel around to video like things in Kenosha? Portland?</p><p><br></p><p>Osh-kosh, other places in WI, but don't necessarily only film political situations, document all different kinds of things, was just at a Comi-Con.</p>
2021-11-03T15:01:42Z<br><p>Chirafisi: On 23rd, taking a day off.</p><p><br></p><p>Sunday, relaxing.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Get call, </p><p><br></p><p>The shooting of Jacob Blake took place.</p><p><br></p><p>Chiraifis: Come down to courthourse.</p><p><br></p><p>Following protestors, to courthouse, public safety building. </p>
2021-11-03T15:03:23Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Show you photographs, tell me if you recognize what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Defense exhibit 31 and 32. </p><p><br></p><p>This is burning garbage trucks. Used these old trucks to make blockades around courthouse. That's 32.</p><p><br></p><p>31 is a waste truck on fire.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: You saw those burning on the 23rd.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p>
2021-11-03T15:04:57Z<br><p>Physical, paper pictures shown to jury, handed to them to pass around.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: You mentioned a large congregation out by courthouse and dinosaur museum?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>IT working again, photos put up on TV.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: People talking about damaging dinosaur museum.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, recognize importance of it. </p>
2021-11-03T15:06:05Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Night of 23rd started to be people downtown that you didn't recognize.  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: You have influence in the community, known in the community, people from out of town?</p><p><br></p><p>Suspicious looking. Attire and actions. Mentioned yesterday, seeing someone in back, maybe the truck you showed on fire, someone in back of truck digging out debris, find stuff to break stuff. </p>
2021-11-03T15:07:35Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Fair to say what we're seeing on screen is a red flag?</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, burning garbage truck.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: On the 24th, think you said it was worse than the 23rd, in terms of damage to buildings and property.</p><p><br></p><p>I believe so.  Trying to be as transparent and fair, a lot that went on that week, didn't get much sleep, trying to recall to best of my knowledge, but yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: On 23rd people out protecting businesses, or a free-for-all?</p><p><br></p><p>Weren't people that you could identify that were protecting businesses? Possibly?  Not that I could say. </p>
2021-11-03T15:08:48Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Did you see a lot of people on 23rd out protecting businesses?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: The 24th, you described it as opportunistic.</p><p><br></p><p>That's what it seemed like.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: You mentioned, witnessed department of corrections, probation, being burned.  Another image. Is that it? Being burned.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.  What it says on the building. </p>
2021-11-03T15:10:05Z<br><p>Chirafisi: That building burns to the ground?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Did you see CAr Source burning that night, 24th?</p><p><br></p><p>I think they have two locations, one closer to Civic Center Park, both are Car Source?</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Exhibit #34, if I said that's picture of fires at Car Source, would that be fair?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: What date?</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: 24th</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T15:11:04Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Did you see any fires there on 25th? </p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: So if I told you that was the Car Souce on the 24th, any reason to dispute that?</p><p><br></p><p>No.  </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Shows video of Car Source lot absolutely ablaze.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, that's the one across from Ruther. </p>
2021-11-03T15:12:06Z<br><p>Chirafisi: On 24th, notice more or less people protecting businesses than on 23rd?</p><p><br></p><p>More, I guess, people had a general idea what was going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Any businesses boarded up on 24th?</p><p><br></p><p>Well, NONE boarded up on the 23rd.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: You noticed more peope protecting property on 24th?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: More out on 25th protecting businesses?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.  Visibly more people.</p>
2021-11-03T15:13:10Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Tell me if this is right, more people protecting businesses, and fewer fires?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, if that's only comparison.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: 24th, more fires, fewer people, 25th, more people, less fires.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Also less people. </p><p><br></p><p>IMPORTANT POINT--presence of people like Kyle was protective, not provocative</p>
2021-11-03T15:14:45Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Appear people were having the opportunity to just damage property on 24th?</p><p><br></p><p>After nightfall, yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: On 25th, you're back out and you're videotaping, running live stream--[to staff]: can you bring up video Binger showed, at 18:22.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Down around Car Source more people to protect that business than the previous two days?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. May have been the owners, I'm not sure.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: More people protecting business, and less property damage by fire that night. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-03T15:16:16Z<br><p>Chirafisi: This is your live stream that Binger had you comment on.  </p><p><br></p><p>Plays video. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi:  Stops video showing a fire that has been started, is going?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I see that. </p><p><br></p><p>Hear Washington on his video: "Oh, yeah, that dumpster [in street] about to be lit up."</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: More people on 25th trying to put out fires once started?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, people with fire extinguishers. </p>
2021-11-03T15:17:04Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Did you see people with extinguishers on 24th?</p><p><br></p><p>Possibly, but probably  not. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Probably not on 24th, but multiple people with extinguishers on 25th?  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Dumpster now seen billowing smoke.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: People right now putting out dumpster fire?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-03T15:18:36Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Were people getting angry when fires put out?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. But objections to everything. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: To be fair, one of the things that made people angry that night is when fires were put out?</p><p><br></p><p>Possibly yes, maybe, it's hard for me, to explain for other people.  I imagine that would make people upset.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Just in terms of people's actions.  You heard, "Why did you put that out?"</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, like that guy said, why'd you do that?</p>
2021-11-03T15:20:32Z<br><p>Plays video more.  "Why'd you do that?"</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: That gentleman is Joseph Rosenbaum.  Did you see him becoming angry at that point?</p><p><br></p><p>To be fair, at that point, not focused on him. Everything I've ever seen of him on the internet, he seemed upset. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Did you hear him scream shoot me, shoot me? </p><p><br></p><p>Seen video of that. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Were you there at the time?</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe, probably?  Do you have video of me there. I've definitely seen video of it. </p>
2021-11-03T15:21:35Z<br><p>Chirafisi: You didn't believe dumpsters being pushed to gas station?</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, maybe I'm wrong, but to me I felt like trying to push them towards the police. What that would do ...</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Fair to say dumpsters being pushed at least near where driveway of gas station is. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, they got them from gas station parking lot.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Reasonable to put out fires near gas stations.</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, I think that's reasonable. </p>
2021-11-03T15:22:47Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Binger asked you if you saw at this location anybody fire a gun, hear a gun? Remember that yesterday?</p><p><br></p><p>By Ultimate, no.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Did you see anybody chase anyboyd else, trying to attack them?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: See anybody on the ground, kicked in face?</p><p><br></p><p>By Ultimate, no?</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: See anybody hit in head with skateboard?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: See anybody chasing somebody point a gun at them, Ultimate?</p><p><br></p><p>No. </p>
2021-11-03T15:23:30Z<br><p>Chirafisi: People throwing rocks?</p><p><br></p><p>Yeah, can hear that on video, several days going on, rocks and things being thrown.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Rocks and have different sizes.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Taking chunks of concrete and breaking them and throwing them, you saw that?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p>
2021-11-03T15:25:03Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Difference between small rock and chunk of concrete?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, can tell by sound of banging that different sizes being thrown.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi:  Watch this video, at 24:00, see Kyle with orange medical bag.  Recognize  him?</p><p><br></p><p>Defendant?</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Yes, Rittenhouse. During this time, appear agitated or irritated?</p><p><br></p><p>Just standing, looking around.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: If he had looked agitated would you have followed him? Acting inappropriate?</p><p><br></p><p>If engaging with someone in inappopriate way, would move to that direction, yes. </p>
2021-11-03T15:25:37Z<br><p>Chirafisi: So nothing about his behavior at Ultimate that made you focus on him at all?</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: He's just walking around like everybody else?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T15:27:09Z<br><p>Chirafisi: You were asked how you got around that night, on a skateboard.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Do you know what the trucks of the skateboard are?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. It's what you attach the wheels to, attaches them to board.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: I fyou were going to swing that skateboard in effort to hurt someone, how would you swing it?</p><p><br></p><p>Depend on situation, plank of wood, however you favor holding a plank of wood?</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Could you grab it by the trucks and swing it?</p><p><br></p><p>Sure.  </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Trucks would let you swing it one-handed?</p><p><br></p><p>I suppose. But could hold board itself with one hand. </p>
2021-11-03T15:29:13Z<br><p>Not an expert at striking people with skateboard, I just ride it. </p><p><br></p><p>Ha!</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Go to 55:47 on video.  </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi:  Binger showed you -- shows scene walking down Sheridan towards the Car Source lot.  </p><p><br></p><p>Man on skateboard going down middle of street.  See Rittenhouse on sidewalk. He's not chasing anybody, is he?</p><p><br></p><p>No, looks like he's headed in a direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Walking as if we were walking just going somewhere?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Doesn't appear to be hurried or going after someone?</p><p><br></p><p>No, not rushing any longer. </p>
2021-11-03T15:30:51Z<br><p>Chirafisi: And he has fire exinguisher.  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, looks like it, he was holding fire extinguisher before. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi:  Now was there a fire right there in street?</p><p><br></p><p>Not sure, can you replay it?  Yeah, looks like a little garbage fire, yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi:  Shows small dumpster knocked over in street.  That's Rosenbaum, he no longer has his shirt on?</p><p><br></p><p>Looks like.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Appear shirt is wrapped around face or head?</p><p><br></p><p>Could be, head or neck area. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Can't see his face, is that fair?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, that's fair. </p>
2021-11-03T15:32:11Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Last thing to show you, the shooting, listen. </p><p><br></p><p>Bang.    Bang-bang-bang-bang.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Heard a shot, heard someone shout F-you!</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Know who yelled that?</p><p><br></p><p>No, sounds like a male.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: We established Ziminsky fired the first shot.</p><p><br></p><p>Heard about that, yeah. </p>
2021-11-03T15:35:08Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Said you kind of took mental note of Rittenhouse, maybe because of age, gloves, things like that.</p><p><br></p><p>Mental note, yeah, of people who kind of stood out to me, a lot of chatter on internet, people are saying randomly killings, targeting black people, you can all see I'm a black man, so I took a note of that, wanted to know who was around. Didn't necessarily believe that was true, but who thought buildings would be set on fire. </p><p><br></p><p>Took mental note of people who stood out, people who were acting erratice, I suppose Mr. Rosenbaum, or people chain smoking with gloves on.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: You described Rosenbaum as acting erratic?</p><p><br></p><p>From all the moments I was around, yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Anything Kyle did that was in any way erratic, threatening, use any term you want, about his behavior?</p><p><br></p><p>Only thing I could say, just my opinion, seemed young, like he didn't see to knowexactly what was going on, if didn't have the gloves on maybe I wouldn't have noticed.  Maybe some technical reason. Not saying I through this was a guy who would mow a bunch of people down.  And when he ran by, remember this guy from before, anyone chasing him? Maybe something happening down that way, headed in that direction, not focusing on him per se, but maybe a situation. </p>
2021-11-03T15:36:39Z<br><p>Chirafisi: About his behavior, acting erratic?</p><p><br></p><p>Chain smoking cigarettes a behavioral thing?</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: OK. So you describe Rosenbaum as erratic and Rittenhouse as chain smoking?</p><p><br></p><p>I suppose you could say nervous.  Not a slight of him, just a mental note. </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi thought he was done, but looks like Richards wants something asked. Lawyers huddling by computer that has exhibits.</p>
2021-11-03T15:38:30Z<br><p>Chirafisi: One more question, Binger asked if you noted any fires at Car Source that evening.</p><p><br></p><p>I think I said I don't recall.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Show you this, tell me if you recall this.  </p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Video of Car Source?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Agree there's a fire inside that truck?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: So there were fires at Car Source that night?</p><p><br></p><p>If this is that night, yes. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T15:39:16ZCourt in recess, to come back in 15 minutes, so 10:55am CT.<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T16:01:37ZWe're back, with re-direct of Washington by Binger<br>
2021-11-03T16:02:40Z<br><p>FYI, at http://lawofselfdefense.com during #KyleRittenhouse trial:</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://24liveblog.tradingfront.cn/event/2911778297784733795/20211103160240_127893.png" width="3452" height="1206" style="width: 3452px; height: 1206px;"></p>
2021-11-03T16:05:58Z<br><p>Binger: Just a few more questions.  We saw in video that there were at least one dumpster in road? Where'd it come from?</p><p><br></p><p>From the gas station parking lot. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Point on map where you believe those dumpsters were originally located before pulled out in the street. Indicating Ultimate gas station, near the Boost Mobile building.  So, if someone wanted to start fire in dumpster and push it towards gas station, wouldn't need to move it?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You use skateboard, use it as a weapon? </p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Most people that night using skateboard to skate on?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p>
2021-11-03T16:07:34Z<br><p>Binger: Your perception of Rosenbaum that night. Since that night you have seen videos of Rosenbaum at various times that night. In YOUR video he is seen sometimes. Hard but put yourself in mindset of that night, at that time did you take any notice of Rosenbaum?</p><p><br></p><p>No. When I saw him, seemed to be operating like everybody else. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T16:07:36Z<br><p>I don't get it--is the state going to wave away all the video the jury will surely see with Rosenbaum acting like a violently? If Washington didn't see that conduct, does the conduct not exist? </p>
2021-11-03T16:07:57Z<br><p>Binger is playing the Washington video going down the street towards Car Source again. </p>
2021-11-03T16:10:33Z<br><p>Binger: We've established the individual shown here is defendant, and on right we saw Richie McGinnis.  Continue video.  </p><p><br></p><p>Voice in background: "These stupid white people."</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: This individual is Joseph Rosenbaum. Would you agree that as you pass by the defendant and Rosenbaum heading south on Sheridan road, that the sequence is Rosenbaum is further south than the defendant, Rittenhouse?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: See house in background, agree that the point of view you are looking west across Sheridan? </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Can you show us the block on Sheridan that has houses on it, between 61st and 62nd?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You are on the east of Sheridan, heading south, on that block?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T16:11:07Z<br><p>Binger: You were asked what Rosenbaum was wearing on face. His face was obscured by shirt. Were YOU wearing a mask?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: A lot of COVID?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: A lot of people had face covering?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p>
2021-11-03T16:13:17ZChirafisi on re-direct of Washington<br><p>Chirafisi: You're not asserting that Rosenbaum is wearing a shirt over his face as a COVID mask?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Objection, speculation.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: You don't know why he's wrapped shirt around face, do you?</p><p><br></p><p>No.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: You were asked by Binger, in terms of direction people;le are heading.  That Rosenbaum is further south than Rittenhouse in that picutre. You'd agree that it doesn't appear Rittenhouse is chasing Rosenbaum?</p><p><br></p><p>No, it doesn't.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Appears that they, like many people, are just walking south?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T16:15:04Z<br><p>Chirafisi: Can you identify picture, D36? Appears to be?</p><p><br></p><p>Appears to be picture of a fire by some wood and a dumpster and people around it.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: Person wearing a bandana, blue?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: If I told you we agree that's Joseph Rosenbaum, at that point, wearing blue bandana over his face?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: So, that's Rosenbaum right there. So, some people were covering their faces for protection from COVID using bandanas? </p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chirafisi: See anybody using their shirt to do the same thing?</p><p><br></p><p>Possibly? Not sure? Maybe, maybe not? Probably not. Other than Joseph Rosenbaum?</p>
2021-11-03T16:15:29ZThat's it for witness Washington<br><p><br></p>

2021-11-03T17:20:24ZBACK FROM LUNCH RECESS<br>
2021-11-03T17:20:38ZContinued direct of Detective Martin by ADA Binger<br>
2021-11-03T17:21:44Z<br><p>Early morning hours of 25th and 26th.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Come a time when you learned identity of person who shot people? </p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Information on social media, and person turned themselves in at Antioch PD.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Prior to turning himself in, info identifying him?</p><p><br></p><p>Pictures circulating on social media.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Figure out identity of the person?</p><p><br></p><p>Early on recall seeing a picture, but don't recall if I knew identity.</p>
2021-11-03T17:23:34Z<br><p>Binger: After he turned himself in, did you go to Antioch?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Defendant claimed injuries?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Documented?</p><p><br></p><p>Half-inch scratch above temple, scratch by lower lip, two inch scratch below left collar bone, some redness to right side of belly button, two inch scracth on left forearm, redness on right forearm, redness on tip of right thumb, and on his back a scratch on left side by shoulder blade, and two bumps on back of his head, above left ear, both of those injuries on head I could not get to turn up on photograph because of thick hair, but could feel with gloved hand, bumps size of penny. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T17:25:31Z<br><p>Binger: That's extent of injuries defendant reported to you?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Also collected physical evidence from scene?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, 63rd St. and Sheridan rode, on 29th of August, citizen called, came to check out area where this happened and located two shell casings. Two .223 Rem shell casings, under silver Chevy Cruze near where Rosenbaum shot.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Mentioned searched social media, internet, gather videos.  Like to go through some of those now. </p>
2021-11-03T17:26:17Z<br><p>This feels like when the prosecution in Zimmerman kept rolling through videos that were helpful to the defense.  Not sure how continually showing videos of chaos in Kenosha helps the state. </p>
2021-11-03T17:27:09Z<br><p>Binger: First video, from news source, Therundownlive</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T17:29:44Z<br><p>Narrator: Here with bunch of militia, protecting car lot, imkage of this other lot across the street burned. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: I object to the audio and the editorialization. Don't mind the video.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Uh, could subpoena the person who recorded.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder: No, there's a confrontation issue. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: May we approach?</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder: No, because will have to be on record, remove jury, no.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Blah, blah, blah.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder: If descriptive material, he's entitled to confront.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Not descriptive.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder: He's already made assertions of fact.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: He just made one.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder: He did. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: We can play without audio, but will be audio of statements of defendant.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder: Statements of defendant admissible. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T17:31:02Z<br><p>Don't understand how Binger could allow this to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course there would be objection to this video, and that objection would be sustained.</p><p><br></p><p>Can't just have a body-less voice on a video as evidence in court. </p><p><br></p><p>It's patent hearsay. </p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder now explaining hearsay to jury. </p>
2021-11-03T17:35:04ZGlitch in live feed--and we're back, missed a bit of Detective Martin<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T17:37:56Z<br><p>Showing the rundown video again, now Rittenhouse visible, turned sound back on. </p><p><br></p><p>Narrator talking.  Rittenhouse chatting, "we have medics, too" but rather had to hear him.</p><p><br></p><p>Sound back off, continue video. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Sorry, mispoke, rewind and sound back on.</p><p><br></p><p>Narrator: They have medics, too, even on other side. </p><p><br></p><p>Rittenhouse: "We have medics, too."</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T17:41:14Z<br><p>Narrator:  We have militia members--</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Turn the sound back off now.  Pause video there. Up on roof there is Dominick Black. </p><p><br></p><p>Video continues to play, on mute. </p><p><br></p><p>ULtimate gas station seen down street in background.</p><p><br></p><p>Skip forward to 30:27 mark. Plays from there on mute. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T17:41:22Z<br><p>Video showing a parking lot full of incinerated cars, not sure how that helps the state. </p>
2021-11-03T17:44:11Z<br><p>Binger:  Video shows Ryan Balch, and saw defendant leaning on car to the right. </p><p><br></p><p>Camera pans to defendant, sound back on.</p><p><br></p><p>Narrator:  So we have the militia here--</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Stop. Sorry. Go to 38:47 mark.  Sound on.  </p><p><br></p><p>More burned cars.  </p><p><br></p><p>Narrator: And we have the militia here.  They're trying to protect private property.  </p>
2021-11-03T17:47:12Z<br><p>Narrator:  </p><p><br></p><p>Crowd: Look at these p***ies on the roof!</p><p><br></p><p>Narrator: Just trying to protect property.  These guys just trying to protect property.   </p><p><br></p><p>Someone in crowd:  They're shining lasers on us.</p><p><br></p><p>Narrator: That's not cool.</p><p><br></p><p>Narrator: Not all militias should have guns. You're upset because someone pointing laser.  </p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  Objection, same, this is editorializing. If he wants to play my client, that's fine.  </p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Just portions describing the scene.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder: Hearsay.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Not for truth of matter asserted.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder:  Then it's irrelevant.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Goes to state of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder: State of mind of who?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: The defendant.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeder: [To clerk] Could you send jury to the library, please?</p>
2021-11-03T17:49:43ZBinger just can't get this right, obvious hearsay<br><p>Judge Schroeder: Court of appeals very strongly condemns sidebars, we've used them for a number of purposes, mostly management issue, but the Court of Appeals wants a full record, can't be done with sidebar, when you state their objections, I've said you have to state the reason.  Now get into this more deeply, so right to excuse jury.</p><p><br></p><p>Judge Schroeer: Glares at Binger.  </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Your Honor ...</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Let me just set the stage here.  I've mentioned reporting of media, and one thing I've heard over again that I messed up this other trial, and in fact I had it right. Disputed matter was testimonial and had to be confronted, and your office appealed, 20 years ago, fine, big case, state supreme court reversed, and said, no, adopt a new rule to be applied in this case about forfeiture, so it came back, I said supreme court will be reversed, unanimous but unsound, and proved positive. [Federal court reversed.]</p>
2021-11-03T17:56:58Z<br><p>Schroeder: I don't want to mess around with confrontation issues. I can't let you introduce evidence into this record that is barred by confrontation rule, and you're telling me you want me to let you run that this guy is saying on grounds that it's to state of mind of defendant?</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: If not testimonial, then it's hearsay. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Defendant is witnessing this. Present sense impression.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Start at beginning. State argues we've been doing this Elijah, gave editorial comments in video, he was here to testify. This guy is not here. He could be, if state brought him, and but they didn't.  There is no proof that what this person is filming is that my client saw it or is part of it. That's WHY this person needs to be here.  I did NOT stipulate to the editorial comments. When they want to play statements of my client, not hearsay, but these statements of narrator to militia, that is hearsay. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Confrontation, this is not testimonial, so confrontation not a valid objection. On hearsay, we had a pre-trial dispute about things Rosenbaum all night long not witnessed by defendant. Defense argue should come in because goes to totality of the circumstances.  I said if defendant did not see those actions, shouldn't come in.  You said they could come in to attack character of deceased individual.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: This is exactly what the defendant witnessed, he was right there. Counsel is saying defendant didn't see what was at scene. I don't know that. Defendant could testify.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Wait a minute, wait a minute. He has no obligation to testify.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Reasonable to say he witnessed this, forming his state of mind, happening right in front of his face, not 10 blocks away, as he is witnesses. If defense wants to argue he didn't witness, they can argue that and jury can make a decision. The hearesay is not being offered to prove the fact of statement.  Can be admitted for present sense impressions, state of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: So many things you're touching on.  Present sense impression, what defendant is aware of re: pictured of video, camera is aimed at him, he's seeing the videographer, but that goal is met by showing muted video. Commentary of videographer is not Rittenhouse source of knowledge. Getting back to Jackson case and ruling the other day, going to comment about the media again, gentleman on TV night before last saying this is most divisive case in country today, anything that undermines public confidence in this trial is very important for this town, this country, to have confidence in result of this trial.  </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T18:02:46Z<br><p>Schroeder: People on media on reputable sites saying things that are bizaare. For example, you talk about things that occured with respect to Rosenbaum, that were unknown to defendant at time, and under one subsection of that statute the defendant has to have been aware, in order to be an opeartive fact. But the uncommunicatwed threat rule which I talked about at the time, Jackson case discussed it somewhat, also at Judge Weinstein's commentaries. Section 7.01(3)(c).</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: If defendant offers evidence of alleged victim's character, it must be in the form of opinion or reputation testimony.  It may not be in the form of other acts. When a defendant offers evidence of character ---  Next paragraph. When defendant offers evide3nce of a homicide victims violent character, but does not show was aware of that character trait at time of incident, defendant is offering the evidene as circumstantial proof of his violent behavior, and the offer false squarely within 404(a)(2)(b).  On the other hand, if defendant aware, evidence is admissible, 404(a)(2)(b). Then evidence of victim's violent character independent of 404(a)(2)(b), </p><p><br></p><p>Two different parts of rule. One is defendant was aware of decedent's violent acts or turbulent behavior. In other one, it's circumstantial evidence of the victim's violent behavior at the time of the incidence. That's what I admitted it on.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: CNN, Jeffrey Toobin, another attorney there, comment made that ruling was incomprehensible. Obviously, they are unfamiliar of this rule. US v. Smith, 230 F2d 300, 2000, this is admissible evidence. But it applies under the statute to the decedent. Does not apply to the defendant. You're mixing rules up here.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: I don't understand any theory under which you can bring in what certainly seems to be to be hearsay when you could just bring in the witness.</p>
2021-11-03T18:04:33Z<br><p>This really doesn't require this much effort or argument. </p><p><br></p><p>State can bring in the witness.  Admissibility criteria for Rosenbaum evidence and this narrator effort are completely different, not comparable.</p>
2021-11-03T18:08:39Z<br><p>Schroeder: My Rosenbaum ruling not incomprehensible, and does not apply to defendant.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Just generallly, I have not watched Toobin or anybody else watch this case, so can't respond to that. </p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: I don't expect to you. My point is I want the case fairly tried. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: This video contains statements from the videographer and other people at scene. The confrontation clause issue--</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: Skip confrontation, do hearsay.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: I am not asserting for truth of matter asserted, because they go to defendant's statee of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Unless this narrator can read minds, ridiculous. This narrator will prove my client's state of mind? That's absurd.  The panapoly of what's going on, if it's not the opinions of the narrator, that goes to what may or may not have been seen by my client. Someone yelling, they're throwing things, there's a layer, I"m not objecitng to that. We're objecting to the person who is running the feed and giving the editorial comments, that is hear say. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: What specifically is this person saying? Is it the word militia?</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: It seems to me that you have the burden why I should admit this video I've never seen before, yolu're offering a running commentary from someone not here to testify, yo'ure expecting me to jump on a moment's notice--</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: My question directed to the defense. I understand objection to militia, I don't think it's hearsay, but if going to deal with that word, I could try and go back, and I would need time to do this, figure out every moment that word is used. </p>
2021-11-03T18:10:07Z<br><p>This is ridiculous. Bring in the narrator as a witness. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Or you could give jury limiting instruction, that this is narrator's opinion, jury should give no weight.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: In 38 years I've NEVER done that. I can play this, and some of it might not be OK, but don't pay attention to that. That's what you're suggesting I do?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: It has been done, perfectly permissible procedure by the court. The jury is presumed to follow your instructions.</p><p><br></p><p>Schroeder: We're going to take a break, it would be prudent to do so at this point.</p><p><br></p><p>[Unstated: Because I'm about to bite your head off, Binger.]</p>
2021-11-03T18:10:16ZDRAMA IN THE COURTROOM!!! :-)<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T18:13:14Z<br><p>I guess the bottom line is that the prosecution has so little evidence inconsistent with lawful self-defense that they're pulling out all the stops to get in anything dirty they can. </p>
2021-11-03T18:35:15ZAnd we're back, jury being brought back in<br><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T18:35:25Z<br><p>Schroeder still looks unhappy. </p>

2021-11-03T18:38:41Z<br><p>Binger: 1:28:56 seconds of video.</p><p><br></p><p>Rittenhouse walking away from camera.  </p><p><br></p><p>Rittenhouse: You need water? </p><p><br></p><p>Rittenhouse interacting with police driving by with in Bearkats.

2021-11-03T18:39:32Z<br><p>Binger: Detective Howard, police vehicles, one close to camera, do you know anything about that, personally?</p><p><br></p><p>Not personally, no.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Does Kenosha have vehicle like that/</p><p><br></p><p>No, they didn't.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Other LEO agencies present?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Whose was that vehicle? </p><p><br></p><p>No, said sheriff's on it. </p>
2021-11-03T18:40:09Z<br><p>So, obviously, Judge Schroeder ruled the narration video inadmissible. </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T18:40:57Z<br><p>Binger: Exhibit #1. Drew Hernandez video, 00:23.</p><p><br></p><p>Found on YouTube, saved from there. </p><p><br></p><p>Also on Twitter.</p><p><br></p><p>Black and white, looks like Sheridan, night time.  </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T18:42:13Z<br><p>Binger: I want to set the stage.  Can you tell where taken?</p><p><br></p><p>Looks like body camera.  Near the Car Source, again.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: The viewpoint in the video is looking southeast across the intersection of Sheridan Road?</p><p><br></p><p>Appears to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Intersection of 59th?</p><p><br></p><p>Leading question, but whatever.</p><p><br></p><p>Looks like 59th and Sheridan. </p>
2021-11-03T18:42:53Z<br><p>Occasional hand comes in front of camera, coughing heard.</p><p><br></p><p>Coming up on Car Source.  People on roof.  </p><p><br></p><p>Shouting man: "We don't need no police, n-word!"  </p>
2021-11-03T18:43:17Z<br><p>Lots of shouting, people arguing. It's like a drunk shout-fest.</p>
2021-11-03T18:43:42Z<br><p>"We're trying to protect property," calm voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Lots of angry shouting back.</p><p><br></p><p>Really not sure how this helps the prosecution. </p>
2021-11-03T18:46:54Z<br><p>No idea what the point of that video was, Binger said nothing about it. Now another video: </p><p><br></p><p>Elijah riot interview, acquired by Det.

2021-11-03T18:47:41Z<br><p>Binger: You know McGinnis?</p><p><br></p><p>Spoke to him briefly, but then when made head of this case, had to delegate.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  McGinnis profession?</p><p><br></p><p>News reporter for Daily Caller.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

Can't get to certain section of BLM, these 20 white dudes, Antifa, can't get up close on them.  They just made an example out of that guy.  The white dude, he just got his phone slapped out, and socked at the same time. This dude walking away.  Phone slapped and blindsided. </p><p><br></p><p>So, protestors attacking individuals.</p><p><br></p><p>Narrator: Orders about yelling no cameras, that is white boys, that's Antifa.  </p><p><br></p><p>Shots fired at Car Source. </p>
2021-11-03T18:57:42Z<br><p>Binger: Freeze frame, individual here who is running, all black with some white--</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Can you do it on other TV so we can see it?</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Sure. </p>
2021-11-03T18:59:36Z<br><p>Binger: This individual, here, who when we play it back, running across here, that is Richie McGinnis, no dispute. </p><p><br></p><p>AFB: Freezeframe looking at Car Source shooting area from across the street, brightly lit Car Source building in background. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Parked cars on right hand side of screen, this is where chase between Rosenbaum and defendant begins. </p><p><br></p><p>AFB: That's where Rosenbaum hid in ambush before final charge at Rittenhouse. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T19:00:08Z<br><p>Can see Rittenhouse fleeing across parking lot, Rosenbaum chasing him, about to throw plastic bag. </p><p><br></p><p>Shots fired. </p>

2021-11-03T19:03:05Z<br><p>Plenty of cameras filming close-up of Rosenbaum body in back of SUV. </p>
2021-11-03T19:08:01Z<br><p>Binger: Drew Hernandez video.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, obtained on Twitter. </p><p><br></p><p>"In route to Car Source."</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T19:08:58Z<br><p>I'm still waiting for the state to present any evidence that's inconsistent with self-defense. </p>
2021-11-03T19:12:03Z<br><p>More video of Car Source lot as Rosenbaum is shot. </p><p><br></p><p>Looks like Binger is trying to show the alignment of Rittenhouse--Rosenbaum--McGinnis.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: You've watched many videos of incident. Eight shots we just heard. Ziminsky fired first shot.  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Joshua Ziminsky, can see in different video, walking slowly southbound in front of Car Source, while the chase is going on through parking lot.  At that time he has handgun in right hand, raises it in air, fires one shot. Then Rittenhouse and Rosenbaum running trhough lot, so Ziminsky shot happens behind them.</p><p><br></p><p>AFB How does that help the prosecution? </p>
2021-11-03T19:12:42Z<br><p>Binger: Then Rittenhouse fires four times, all hits on Rosenbaum.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Have you timed the gap in time between Ziminsky initial shot and first of Defendant's four shots?  </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, about 2.5 seconds, using a stopwatch.</p><p><br></p><p>AFB: A STOPWATCH?</p>
2021-11-03T19:13:15Z<br><p>Binger: Then three shots after that. Not by defendant.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Where from, if you know?</p><p><br></p><p>I think from 63rd St. but hard to confirm, no good video of that source of gunfire. </p>
2021-11-03T19:16:34Z<br><p>Video of Rittenhouse by Rosenbaum, on phone, then turns and runs towards police line as angry crowd closes in. </p>
2021-11-03T19:17:24Z<br><p>Binger: Exhibit #15, McGinnis at Rosenbaum's body.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T19:19:27Z<br><p>Frantic crowed ineptly tries to aid the shot Rosenbaum. Can hear agonal breathing. </p>
2021-11-03T19:23:34Z<br><p>Now video of Rittenhouse running down Sheridan to the police line.</p><p><br></p><p>He's pursued by mob. </p><p><br></p><p>He'll be knocked down (prosecution says, "tripped over his own feet") in a moment, then stomped by drop kick man, attacked with skateboard to head by Huber, attempted to be shot with Glock by Grosskreutz. </p><p><br></p><p>Sure enough--more gunshots from Kyle.  Drop kick man missed twice, Huber shot once and killed, Grosskreutz shot once hit in arm.</p>
2021-11-03T19:24:43Z<br><p>Binger: Now people huddled around spot on road. </p><p><br></p><p>That's Huber, where he fell.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Next exhibit #6, CJTV running video.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: All this video after shooting Rosenbaum, running north on Sheridan.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p>
2021-11-03T19:25:37Z<br><p>Binger: Person holding arm running off to side. Gaige Grosskreutz?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T19:26:13Z<br><p>Grosskreutz screaming for a medic.</p><p><br></p><p>Bystander sees bicep wound: "Oh, F me!"</p>

2021-11-03T19:30:23Z<br><p>Rittenhouse shown on video, hands up, walking up to police vehicles. They drive past him to get to scene of shooting.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Back to beginning, highlight some things for jury. </p><p><br></p><p>Beginning was where Kyle knocked/tripped/stumbled to street. </p><p><br></p><p>Man runs up and strikes blow at back of Rittenhouse head as Kyle's running for police. </p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Running from right of screen, skateboard, Huber, no dispute.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: This difficult to see pause, represent no dispute, defendant Rittenhouse, this is Huber, picking up skateboard, continuing after defendant. Another individual will come in an attempt to kick Rittenhouse [drop kick man].</p>
2021-11-03T19:30:59Z<br><p>Poor Gaige Grosskreutz--everybody wants to play Glock games until it's time to do Glock stuff, and the other guy has an AR. </p>
2021-11-03T19:31:42Z<br><p>Binger: How many times did Rittenhouse fire?</p><p><br></p><p>Eight times. Four into Rosenbaum, two at drop kick man, seventy shot at Huber, and eighth at Grosskreutz.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T19:32:21Z<br><p>Binger: Now hearing other rounds, after the 8. None of those fired by the defendant, correct?</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p>
2021-11-03T19:34:01Z<br><p>Binger: At end, defendant approaches Kenosha PD squad car.</p><p><br></p><p>Officers Marietti and Krieger (sp?)</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: Exhibit #4, Ziminsky after Rosenbaum shooting. </p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T19:39:09Z<br><p>Mrs. Ziminsky screaming and cursing and hating on the police protecting government buildings from arson--not sure how that helps the prosecution. </p>
2021-11-03T19:39:47Z<br><p>Binger: Rosenbaum have any weapon of any kind?</p><p><br></p><p>No evidence of that.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger: No gun, knife, bat, club. </p><p><br></p><p>No. </p>

2021-11-03T20:26:44Z<br><p>OK audio back. </p>
2021-11-03T20:27:25Z<br><p>Binger: Before break showing you a still from hernandez video 029, focused on Rosenbaum. Now exhibit #24, close-up of plastic bag.   Does that show the plastic bag that Rosenbaum carrying around?</p><p><br></p><p>Appears to be, yes. </p>
2021-11-03T20:28:40Z<br><p>Binger: Aerial surveillance video from FBI. </p><p><br></p><p>IR vide.</p><p><br></p><p>Note that this is shown in NON-composite form, unlike previous forms of this video shared publicly. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T20:31:40Z<br><p>Binger didn't ask a single question about that video.</p><p><br></p><p>I don't understand why Martin is there in witness stand, so videos can be played without any testimony from him.  </p><p><br></p><p>At least ask some perfunctory question--is this a fair representation of Car Source the night of 25th? Something like that. Otherwise he's literally serving no purpose. </p><p><br></p><p>Switches to another exhibit he doesn't testify about.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally a third, now asks Martin questions.</p><p>All last three segments of the FBI IR video. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
2021-11-03T20:32:40Z<br><p>Binger: Who are "persons of interest" marked on video?</p><p><br></p><p>Martin: Rosenbaum and Rittenhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>Video shows Rosenbaum relentlessly pursuing Rittenhouse across Car Source parking lot, to point of contact.</p><p><br></p><p>I don't understand how this helps the state disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
2021-11-03T20:35:05Z<br><p>Binger: Did all events in these videos occur in Kenosha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Binger:  Is defendant in this courtroom?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, there he is. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

2021-11-03T20:37:05Z<br><p>Richards: Put a lot of time in this case?</p><p><br></p><p>Months.</p><p><br></p><p>Before August there were three Car Sources.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>First burned to ground night of 24th.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, ongoing business on 24th, it wasn't boarded up on 24th, it was boarded up because of the civil unrest.</p><p><br></p><p>Car Source #3, ongoing business, not boarded up, not damanged,. </p>

2021-11-03T20:39:30Z<br><p>Richards: Not the standard thorough investigation, cones down, photograph everybody. </p><p><br></p><p>Techs gathered what they were able to observe that night. </p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Nothing hiding those shell cases if they had done a thorough search.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: You went and got a bunch of information through documents. Multiple search warrants, subpoenas for records, and a lot of those directed at my client's social medeia. Telephone social media, all of that multple email, Facebook, TikTok, so you can get as much background on individual who is the suspect.</p><p><br></p><p>Correct. </p>
2021-11-03T20:40:25Z<br><p>Richards: All done after that night, don't have to worry abou that evidence going away, companies give it to you. </p><p><br></p><p>First send preservation record, then search warrant need not be rushed.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Get that to provide jury a full and complete picture.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: You looked through all of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: A lot of interest in subject's cell phones.</p><p><br></p><p>yes. </p>

Hold the phone so if they don't consent nothing can be destroyed. If consent, you can just downloaded.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p>
2021-11-03T20:42:47Z<br><p>Richards: Some cell phones are not crackable.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: Unless you have the code, can't open it. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Rittenhouse on most recent iOS, and there was no software to crack it.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards: You got phone, sent it to FBI, they told you they can't crack it.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Richards:  We found out, offered you the code if we got record.
